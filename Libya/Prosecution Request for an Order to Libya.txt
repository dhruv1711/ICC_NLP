Submissions
1. In light of the recent reports indicating the commencement of trial in Libya
against Messrs Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi (“Gaddafi”) and Abdullah Al-Senussi (“Al- Senussi”), among others, for their alleged role during the Libya’s 2011 uprising, the
Prosecution seeks an order from the Chamber to determine the status of Libya’s
efforts to surrender Mr Gaddafi to the Court and to give assurances that its domestic
proceedings will not impede its obligations to cooperate with the Court. 2. The Prosecution notes with concern media reports on the decision of a
Libyan court that the trial of Mr Gaddafi, a suspect before the Court, is currently
being conducted via video-link from his place of detention in Zintan.1 These reports
indicate that the Libyan government intends to proceed with prosecuting Mr
Gaddafi domestically, despite its clear continuing obligation to surrender him
forthwith to the Court.2
3. Libya’s decision to prosecute Mr Gaddafi is troubling in light of Libya’s
acknowledgement that it is bound to surrender him to the Court and the Appeals
Chamber denial of Libya’s request for the appeal of this Chamber’s Admissibility
Decision to have suspensive effect.3
4. Similarly, the Prosecution notes that Libya has begun trial proceedings
against Mr Al-Senussi while the appeal of the admissibility decision is pending. In
this respect, Libya should be reminded that its domestic proceedings against Mr Al- Senussi are subject to its obligations to cooperate with the Court and that it should

Request”), para. 3; Appeals Decision on suspensive effect, paras. 23, 27.

refrain from any action that would frustrate the Court’s ability to exercise
jurisdiction, should the admissibility decision in Mr Al-Senussi’s case be reversed on
appeal.4
5. In view of its obligation to surrender Mr Gaddafi to the Court, Libya is
bound to abstain from any initiative, measure or action which could result in
frustrating the Court’s legitimate expectations that he will be surrendered to the
Court and that it will be possible for the case against him to resume before the
Court.5
6. Throughout its pleadings in the admissibility proceedings in this case, Libya
maintained that it is capable of obtaining custody of Mr Gaddafi. In challenging a
contrary finding of the Pre-Trial Chamber in the Admissibility Decision, Libya
argued that the Pre-Trial Chamber had incorrectly equated the fact that Mr Gaddafi
has not been transferred to Tripoli with Libya’s inability to obtain custody of him.6
Libya asserted that the Pre-Trial Chamber failed to recognise that “the Zintan
Brigade is a Government-sanctioned local authority” and that it is able to exercise its
authority over Mr Gaddafi alongside the local authority in Zintan.7
7. Despite this claimed authority and capability, Libya has failed to date to
surrender Mr Gaddafi to the Court. This contradiction calls for clarification on the
record.
4 In the Al-Senussi Admissibility Proceedings where the case was found inadmissible by the Pre-Trial Chamber, the Appeals Chamber recalled that Libya’s obligation to cooperate with the Court arises from United Nations
Security Council Resolution 1970 (2011) referring the situation to the Court and has to be performed in
accordance with the principle of good faith, which pervades all obligations arising under international law,
including those arising in connection with the United Nations Charter. The Appeals Chamber reminded Libya
that: “throughout the duration of the proceedings relating to the Appeal, it is bound to abstain from any
initiative, measure or action which could result in frustrating the Court's legitimate expectations that, should the
Impugned Decision be reversed, it will be possible for the case against Mr Al-Senussi to actually resume before
the Court”. Appeals Chamber, Decision on the request for suspensive effect and the request to file a
consolidated reply, 22 November 2013, ICC-01/11-01/11-480, paras. 18-19. 5 Ibid. A fortiori, these obligations should be sustained in Mr Gaddafi’s proceedings where the case was found
admissible and Libya is subject to a continuing obligation to surrender him to the Court. 6 Document in Support of the Government of Libya’s Appeal against the “Decision on the admissibility of the
case against Saif Al-Islam Gaddafi”, 31 May 2013, ICC-01/11-01/11-370-Red3, para. 161. 7 Ibid., paras. 157 – 161.

8. For the foregoing reasons, the Prosecution respectfully requests the
Chamber to order Libya to:
a) Inform the Chamber as to whether trial proceedings are indeed being
conducted against Messrs Gaddafi and Al-Senussi in Libya;
b) Provide assurances that the outcome of its domestic proceedings will
not hinder the implementation of the Request to surrender Mr Gaddafi
to the Court, nor hinder its potential obligation to surrender Mr Al- Senussi, should the Appeals Chamber reverse the inadmissibility
decision against him; and
c) Update the Chamber on its ability and efforts, if any, to surrender Mr
Gaddafi to the Court and to do so, on a regular basis until the
Surrender Request is implemented.
