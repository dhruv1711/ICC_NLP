Introduction
1. The Prosecution opposes the proposal by the Registrar that Registry personnel
travel to Libya to discuss with Libyan authorities the request for arrest and
surrender for Saif Al‐Islam Gaddafi and to assist in their implementation thereof.  
In light of the current circumstances, and in particular the Libyan appointment of
a liaison person and its letter to this Chamber, the Registrar’s proposal will serve
no purpose at this time.  
Background
2. On 23 November 2011 the Chairperson of the Libyan government (National
Transitional Council or “NTC”) sent a letter to Pre‐Trial Chamber I confirming
that the Libyan authorities had arrested Saif Al‐Islam Gaddafi (“Saif Al‐Islam”).  
He informed the Court that the Libyan authorities were undertaking an
investigation into crimes allegedly committed by Saif Al‐Islam, including those
committed since 15 February 2011.1    He also confirmed the Libyan authorities’
willingness and ability to prosecute Saif Al‐Islam and its intent to postpone the
execution of the arrest warrant under Article 94 pending discussions with the
Court.  
3. On 22 and 23 November the Prosecutor met with representatives of the NTC in
Libya, including Dr. Ahmed Al‐Saddik Al‐Jahani. On 25 November 2011, the
Prosecutor informed the Chamber of his meetings in Libya with representatives
of the NTC.2   
4. The NTC issued a notice appointing Dr. Ahmed Al‐Saddik Al‐Jahani to be its
liaison person with the Court.3

5. On 25 November, the Registrar informed the Chamber that “(1) On 24 November
2011, the Registry sent a Request for Assistance to the Embassy of Libya in The
Hague requesting the Libyan authorities to provide a report on the execution of
the request for arrest and surrender for urgent transmission to Pre‐Trial Chamber
I; (2) the Registry is planning to go to Tripoli to discuss the implementation of the
request for arrest and surrender transmitted to the Libyan authorities and to assist
them with its implementation within the framework of the Rome Statute; (3) the
Registry is available to discuss with the Chamber the parameters of the
discussions to be conducted with the Libyan authorities.”4
6. In the letter sent to the Pre‐Trial Chamber on 23 November, the Libyan authorities
specifically state that they do not intend to surrender Saif Al‐Islam pending
discussions with the Court in accordance with article 94.    They are, moreover,
holding him in custody for their own investigations, so any delay in the surrender
will not enable him to avoid the jurisdiction of this Court.     
Submissions
7. The Libyan authorities have indicated that they are not in a position to execute
the surrender of Saif Al‐Islam at this time. Given the Libyan authorities’ clearly
stated position, the proposed visit by Registry personnel to Libya to “discuss the
implementation of the request for arrest and surrender” will serve no purpose at
this point.  
8. Furthermore, the Prosecution submits, this Chamber is now seized of this issue
and it is within the sole competence of the Chamber to decide the next steps that
must be undertaken.

9. The Prosecutor suggests that, should the Chamber have any question on the
application of Article 94, it could request further submissions from the Libyan
authorities and, in particular, from Dr. Al‐Jahani, the appointed liaison person. 5
