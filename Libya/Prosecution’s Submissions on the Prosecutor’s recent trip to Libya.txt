Submissions
1. On 19 November 2011, representatives of the Libyan government (National
Transitional Council or “NTC”) announced that Saif Al‐Islam GADDAFI (“Saif
Al‐Islam”) had been arrested in Libya and was in Libyan custody.1  
2. The Libyan Minister of Justice also announced that the Libyan authorities would
retain custody of Saif Al‐Islam and that they wanted to pursue his prosecution for
crimes committed during the recent uprising after 15 February 2011.  Following
this announcement, the Prosecutor contacted the Libyan Minister of Justice to
confirm the arrest and ensure the proper coordination of the investigation and the
timing of the eventual surrender of Saif Al‐Islam. In response to this initial
contact, the Libyan authorities invited the Prosecutor to visit Libya to further
discuss the NTC’s position with respect to the pending proceedings against Saif
Al Islam before this Court.
3. On Tuesday, 22 November 2011, the Prosecutor, the Deputy Prosecutor and other
members of the Office of the Prosecutor met with the Libyan Minister of Justice,
who invited the Prosecutor, to visit Saif Al‐Islam in custody.  Responding to the
Prosecutor’s question, the Minister clarified that the detainee had not requested
this meeting. The Prosecutor accordingly declined to meet with the detainee
without a request from Saif Al‐Islam and the presence of his lawyer.  The Minister
of Justice informed the Prosecutor that he had visited the detainee and further
assured the Prosecutor that Saif Al‐Islam was in good health and that the
conditions of detention were appropriate.   That same day, the ICRC visited Saif
Al‐Islam in prison and confirmed that he appeared to be in good health. In

addition, Saif‐Al‐Islam was interviewed by a TV channel for half an hour and
expressed his satisfaction with his conditions. The Minister of Justice also stated
that he could not confirm the capture of Abdullah Al‐Senussi.   
4. Later, the delegation of the Office met the Chairman of the NTC and the Prime
Minister. The Libyan highest authorities expressed their gratitude for the
International Criminal Court’s intervention, highlighted its positive impact and
explained that it was important for the Libyan people to hold a trial against Saif
Al‐Islam in Libya.  
5. The Libyan authorities invoked the Rome Statute’s provisions acknowledging the
primacy of national jurisdictions and stated their commitment to conduct a fair
trial.    Secondly, the Libyan authorities informed the Prosecutor that there were
other criminal cases pending against Saif Al‐Islam which are separate and
unrelated to the violent crimes committed during the uprising after February
2011.   
6. The Libyan authorities suggested that the ICC might provide advice and might
thereafter monitor the domestic proceedings.  
7. The Prosecutor confirmed that the Rome Statute provides for the primacy of the
national jurisdiction but that the Libyan authorities must challenge the
admissibility of the case in order for the judges of the ICC to make a final
decision. Furthermore, the Prosecutor clearly stated that if the Chamber accepts
that the case is inadmissible because the case is being investigated or prosecuted
by Libya, a State which has jurisdiction over it, it is not within the mandate of the
Office of the Prosecutor to serve as adviser or to monitor a domestic trial.   
8. The Prosecutor also explained that Article 94 of the Rome Statute addresses the
possibility of sequencing trials if they relate to crimes that are different from those

crimes pending before this Court, and that the Libyan authorities might propose
options to the Court in order to reach an agreement.    
9. Finally, the Prosecutor proposed as a third possibility that the International
Criminal Court might , subject to the judges’ approval, conduct the trial against
Saif Al‐Islam in Libya.    This process could start with the first appearance and
subsequently with the confirmation of charges on Libyan territory. The Libyan
authorities did not rule out that option, but also did not endorse or accept it at
that meeting.  
10. The following morning, on Wednesday, 23 November, the Prosecutor met once
again with the Minister of Justice and other lawyers, including  
Dr. Salwa Fawzi El‐Deghali, in charge of Legal Affairs and Women for the NTC.
They discussed the Article 94 sequencing issues in more detail and the Minister
asked for more information about the process to challenge the admissibility of a
case before this Court as set out in Articles 17 and 19.  
11. Taking into consideration that the mandate of the Minister of Justice was expiring
the same day of the discussion, the Prosecutor requested a letter clarifying the
Libyan position for the judges of this Court from the Chairman of the National
Transitional Council, Mustafa Abdel Jalil.    
12. Thereafter, the Minister of Justice and the Prosecutor held a joint press conference.  
The Minister stated that the Libyan authorities would conduct the trial in Libya
but would coordinate with the ICC.  The Prosecutor stated that he was in Libya to
ensure coordination and that the final decision on the jurisdiction of the case will
be adopted by the Judges of the International Criminal Court.   Many questions
were raised relating to the possibility of holding a fair trial in Libya and the
possible role of the International Criminal Court to monitor such a trial. The

Prosecutor reiterated that the Judges would decide the question of admissibility
of the pending case against Saif Al‐Islam, that the Libyan authorities expressed
their commitment to conduct a fair trial, and that if Libya were authorized to
proceed with the trial, the OTP would not monitor the fairness of the domestic
proceedings, as this is not the role of the Prosecutor.2   
13. That same afternoon, the Prosecutor received a letter from the Chairman of the
NTC addressed to the President of Pre‐Trial Chamber I. The Prosecution faxed the
letter and an ad hoc translation to the President of the Chamber3.    The letter
expresses the Libyan authorities’ respect for the Court and for its obligations
under the Security Council resolution; it confirms the arrest of Saif Al‐Islam and
its investigation of him including for crimes committed after 15 February; and it
affirms its primary jurisdiction to prosecute the suspect, its willingness and ability
to do so under Libyan law, and its intent to (a) postpone execution of the arrest
warrant pending discussions with the Court and (b) work closely with the
Prosecution and the Pre‐Trial Chamber to facilitate this process.    
14. The Prosecutor later met with the Libyan General Prosecutor, who is in charge of
the cases against Saif Al‐Islam.  The General Prosecutor explained that there are
five cases of embezzlement under investigation against Saif Al‐Islam at an
advanced investigative stage, and that they have also started investigating the
crimes committed during the uprising, after 15 February 2011.
