Introduction
1. On 22 March 2012, Libya notified the Chamber of its intention to challenge the
admissibility of the case concerning Saif Al‐Islam pursuant to articles 19(2)(b), (5),
and (6) by 30 April 2012 and requested, pending a decision on this challenge, that
the Pre‐Trial Chamber suspend its execution of the surrender request in relation
to Saif Al‐Islam Gaddafi in accordance with, inter alia, article 95 and rule 58.1
2. On 4 April 2012, the Pre‐Trial Chamber denied the request, stating that article 95
only applies if there is an admissibility challenge under consideration by the
Court pursuant to articles 18 or 19. The Chamber then noted that the Libyan
authorities had not made an admissibility challenge, but only announced that
one is forthcoming.2 The Chamber therefore rejected Libya’s request and did not
consider it necessary to determine whether article 95 applies to surrender
requests.3  
3. On 10 April 2012, Libya sought leave to appeal the decision’s statutory
interpretation of article 95.
4. In the narrow circumstances of the instant proceedings, where Libya is a direct
party to the order immediately directed against it, from which it seeks leave to
appeal, and where the order is related to – indeed, rejects – Libya’s request to
suspend Saif Al‐Islam’s surrender for an additional few weeks within which it
will make an admissibility challenge, the Prosecution agrees that Libya has
standing to seek leave to appeal.
5. In light of the context in which the application is brought and the complexity and
the importance of the issues that arise from the Pre‐Trial Chamber’s decision, the
Prosecution does not oppose Libya’s application.

Background
6. On 27 June 2011, the Chamber issued a warrant of arrest against, among others,
Saif Al‐Islam Gaddafi.4 On 5 July 2011, the Registrar notified the Libyan
authorities of a request for cooperation asking for their assistance in arresting Saif
Al‐Islam and surrendering him to the Court (the ʺSurrender Requestʺ).5
7. On 23 November 2011, a letter from the National Transitional Council was
transmitted to the Chamber. The letter confirmed the arrest of Saif Al‐Islam on 19
November 2011 in Libya.6
8. On 23 January 2012, the Libyan authorities sought, pursuant to article 94,
postponement of the Surrender Request pending the completion of national
proceedings in relation to other crimes against Saif Al‐Islam (the  ʺFirst
Postponement Requestʺ).7
9. On 7 March 2012, the Chamber dismissed the First Postponement Request and
requested that Libya make its decision to grant the Surrender Request and inform
the Chamber accordingly.8  
10. On 22 March 2012, Libya notified the Chamber of its intention to challenge the
admissibility of the case concerning Saif Al‐Islam pursuant to articles 19(2)(b), (5),
and (6) by 30 April 2012 and requested, pending a decision on this challenge, that
the Pre‐Trial Chamber suspend its Surrender Request in accordance with, inter
alia, article 95 and rule 58 (the ʺSecond Postponement Requestʺ).9
11. On 30 March 2012, the Office of Public Counsel for the Defence (the  ʺOPCDʺ),
having been previously authorised by the Chamber to represent the general
interests of Saif Al‐Islam,10 opposed the Second Postponement Request.11

12. On 4 April 2012, the Pre‐Trial Chamber denied the Second Postponement
Request (“the Decision”).12 The Chamber stated that the provisions relied upon
by Libya (article 95 and rule 58) only apply if there is an admissibility challenge
under consideration by the Court pursuant to articles 18 or 19. The Chamber then
noted that the Libyan authorities had not made an admissibility challenge, but
only announced that one is forthcoming.13 The Chamber therefore rejected
Libya’s Request and did not consider it necessary to determine whether article 95
applies to surrender requests.14  
13. On 10 April 2012, Libya sought leave to appeal the Decision (the “Application”)
and simultaneously filed a direct appeal before the Appeals Chamber.15
14. On 12 April 2012, the Office of Public Counsel for the Defence (“OPCD”)
responded to Libya’s Application and Appeal.16
Submissions
15. The Prosecutor acknowledges that absent a challenge to the admissibility of the
case Libya is not a party to the current pre‐confirmation proceeding. However,
the order for which appeal is sought is directed exclusively to Libya and not to
either the Prosecution or the suspect. Therefore, Libya is clearly a party to this
confined proceeding, having been subject to a direct order by the Court. It is
seemingly inconsistent to say that the Court may order a State to take specific
action while also denying the State the status of party to the proceeding out of
which the order against it arises.  
16. In this respect, the situation is also clearly distinguishable from the asylum
litigation before Trial Chamber I, in which the Appeals Chamber dismissed an
 11 ICC-01/11-01/11-94-Conf-Red with confidential annex.

appeal by the Kingdom of the Netherlands.  In that matter, while the State had an
interest in the Trial Chamber’s decision concerning the ability of a witness to
claim asylum in the national court, it was not itself subject to an order of the
Court.17    
17. Thus, in the Prosecution’s view, in the narrow circumstances of the instant
proceedings, where Libya is a direct party to the order immediately directed
against it, from which it seeks leave to appeal, and where the order is related to –
indeed, rejects – Libya’s request to suspend the surrender of Saif Al‐Islam for an
additional few weeks within which to make an admissibility challenge  ‐‐ Libya
may be considered to be a “party” for these confined purposes.   
18. The Prosecution further notes that the decision has an obvious impact on the fair
and expeditious conduct of the proceedings or the outcome of the trial.    The
ability of Libya to invoke article 95 before surrendering the person affects both
fairness and expedition, and also potentially affects whether there will even be a
trial outcome in this Court. This is particularly relevant in the instant case, as
Libya has claimed that it will make a formal admissibility challenge shortly  
19. Finally, the Prosecution submits that appellate resolution of the issue may
materially advance the proceedings.  It will first provide clarity as to the issue of
whether a State may request a postponement of surrender under article 95 to
permit it to file an admissibility challenge, which is an issue of general interest
for the Court. And by providing an authoritative determination as to whether
Libya must proceed to the surrender of the suspect regardless of its evinced
intention to challenge admissibility and the accompanying request for
postponement, it will bolster the efficient conduct of the instant proceedings.   

17 ICC-01/04-01/06-2779, para.12. The Prosecution is equally mindful of the Appeals Chamber’s jurisprudence
on interlocutory appeals: ICC-01/04-01/06-2799 OA19, para.7.

Conclusion
20. For the above mentioned reasons, the Prosecution does not oppose leave to
appeal being granted.
