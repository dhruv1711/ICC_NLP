Introduction
1. The Prosecution opposes the request by the Office of Public Counsel for the
Defence (“OPCD”) to present observations on the Prosecution’s factual
submissions regarding the Prosecutor’s recent trip to Libya.1    OPCD makes
factual and legal submissions, notwithstanding that it is not a party or participant
and has not been authorized to do so.  Furthermore, the Prosecution did not raise
any of the legal issues addressed by OPCD. Accordingly, its substantive
submissions are premature and do not respond to the Prosecutor’s filing.  Finally,
OPCD makes incorrect factual assertions that bear correcting.  
Background
2. On 19 November 2011, representatives of the Libyan government (National
Transitional Council (“NTC”) announced that Saif Al‐Islam Gaddafi had been
arrested in Libya. The Libyan Minister of Justice also announced that the Libyan
authorities would retain custody of Saif Al‐Islam to pursue his prosecution for
crimes committed during the recent uprising.  
3. Following this announcement, the Prosecutor contacted the Libyan Minister of
Justice to confirm Saif Al‐Islam’s arrest and ensure proper coordination of the
investigation and the timing of his eventual surrender.    The Libyan authorities
invited the Prosecutor to visit Libya to further discuss position of the NTC with
respect to the pending proceedings against Saif Al‐Islam before this Court.  
4. From 22 November through 23 November, the Prosecutor, the Deputy Prosecutor
and other members of the Office of the Prosecutor travelled to Libya and met with
the Chairman of the NTC, the Prime Minister and the Justice Minister, among

 ICC-01/11-01/11-33. The Prosecutor’s filing referred to is ICC-01/11-01/11-31 (“Prosecution’s Submissions on
the Prosecutor’s recent trip to Libya”).

others.  The Libyan authorities informed the Prosecutor that they wanted to hold
the trial against Saif Al‐Islam in Libya and they were willing and able to conduct
a fair trial.   
5. On 23 November, the Prosecutor received a letter from the Chairman of the NTC
addressed to the President of Pre‐Trial Chamber I in which the Libyan authorities
confirmed their intent to invoke Article 94 and to seek to postpone the surrender
of Saif Al‐Islam pending discussions with the Court. The Prosecution faxed the
letter and an ad hoc translation to the President of the Chamber.2      
6. On 25 November, the Prosecutor informed the Chamber of his recent trip to Libya
and his discussions with the Libyan authorities.3 Specifically, the Prosecutor
stated that the Libyan authorities had expressed their intention to prosecute Saif
Al‐Islam in Libya. According to the Libyan authorities, its investigation is
focusing on the violent crimes committed during the uprising after February 2011
and unrelated allegations of corruption and embezzlement. In the context of
informing the Chamber about his meetings, the Prosecutor requested a status
conference to provide further details.4  
7. On 28 November 2011, OPCD requested to appear before Pre‐Trial Chamber I or
to submit written observations in response to the Prosecutor’s filing (“OPCD’s
Observations”). According to OPCD, the Prosecutor’s filing raises issues related
to: (1) the status of the legal proceedings in Libya and whether any concrete
investigative steps had been taken by the Libyan authorities; (2) the criteria for
determining Libya’s willingness and ability to prosecute the case; and (3) the legal
basis for Saif Al‐Islam’s arrest. OPCD requests authorization to respond on these

issues pursuant to its mandate under Regulations 77(4) and (5) of the Regulations
of the Court (“RoC”).5
Submissions
8. OPCD ignores the purpose of the Prosecutor’s filing, which was to inform the
Chamber of the rapidly developing events immediately after Saif Al‐Islam’s arrest
and the Prosecutor’s meetings with the Libyan authorities. Instead, in the guise of
seeking the right to participate in any proceedings convened by the Chamber,
OPCD argues numerous abstract legal issues, including admissibility, the role of
the Prosecutor, and the legitimacy of the Libyan authorities’ arrest and detention
of Saif Al‐Islam.   
9. The OPCD arguments are premature in two respects:  its substantive participation
has not been authorized, and the issues it addresses are also not before the Court.
It also misstates the facts, incorrectly attributing to the Prosecution statements or
omissions that are contrary to the Prosecutor’s in‐court submission.  
10. On the first, notwithstanding that OPCD formally asked the Chamber for
authorisation to make submissions “in any proceedings convened by the Pre‐Trial
Chamber”,6 it also included unauthorized substantive arguments in the body of
its filing.7 The right to participate in proceedings before this Court cannot be
inferred. Only parties and authorized participants are allowed to litigate before
this Court. The Prosecution submits that OPCD is neither a party nor has it been
granted leave to participate in these proceedings. Accordingly, OPCD should not
be permitted to make substantive submissions without prior authorization.

11. OPCD’s reliance on Regulation 77(4) and (5) of the RoC is misplaced. These
provide that the OPCD will be available to represent and protect the rights of the
Defence during initial stages (Regulation 77(4)) and to provide support and
assistance (Regulation 77(5)). Neither provision confers on it the automatic right
to initiate or participate in proceedings. Indeed, Regulation 77(4) specifically
identifies two early stages in which OPCD participation is contemplated
(proceedings under Article 56(2)(d) and Rule 47(2)), but in each instance prior
leave or express appointment from a Chamber is required. And OPCD has
generally participated in the initial stages of the proceedings, to assist with the
general interests of the Defence, only after prior authorization8 and upon a
finding that its participation was appropriate to safeguard the interests of the
Defence.9  
12. Additionally, OPCD’s reliance on the Kony case to justify its participation in the
instant proceedings is misplaced.10 The Pre‐Trial Chamber in the Kony case
decided proprio motu to assess the admissibility of the case under the Chamber’s
authority pursuant to Article 19(1). But that decision did not automatically
authorize the participation of defence counsel. Rather, the Chamber only
appointed a defence counsel (not OPCD) after it first determined that the defence
should be represented. 11   
13. Substantively, OPCD’s Observations are also premature. OPCD is not responding
to any legal arguments presented by the Prosecution, since the Prosecution made
none, but presented only a factual recitation of the events to date. And OPCD is

 See for instance ICC-01/04-329 and ICC-02/05-85 whereby PTCI authorized OPCD to reply to victims’
applications to participate in the proceedings. See also ICC-01/04-374, para.22, in which Pre-Trial Chamber I
explained Regulation 77(4) and OPCD’s role following its appointment by the Single Judge to assist with the
general interests of the Defence.

sufficient for the general interests of the Defence to be represented by the OPCD” (emphasis added). 10 OPCD’s Observations, paras.28-29.

not attempting to correct the Prosecution’s version of the meetings with Libyan
authorities. In addition, there is no legal issue yet before the Chamber. Unlike in
Kony, where representation of the interests of the absent suspects was authorized
once the Chamber determined that the question of admissibility was squarely
before it, admissibility is not yet a ripe issue in this case. Crucially, the Libyan
authorities have not formally challenged admissibility.    They may do so in the
future, but the early representations are that they seek to postpone Saif Al‐Islam’s
surrender pursuant to Article 94 to allow it to continue its ongoing investigation.   
14. Finally, the OPCD incorrectly states that the Prosecutor had not requested the
surrender of Saif Al‐Islam after he had been arrested by the Libyan authorities.12
On the contrary, the Prosecutor noted in his filing that he contacted the Libyan
Minister of Justice to confirm the arrest and the timing of the eventual surrender
of Saif Al‐Islam.13 OPCD also erroneously claims that the Prosecutor had not
informed the Libyan authorities of their legal obligations before the Court.14 The
Prosecutor noted in his filing that he informed the Libyan authorities that they
must challenge the admissibility of the case and the Judges must make a final
decision. He also explained that Article 94 addresses the possibility of sequencing
trials if they relate to crimes that are different from those crimes pending before
the Court and it is the responsibility of the Libyan authorities to invoke Article
94.15

Conclusion
15. For the reasons stated above, the Prosecutor requests that the Chamber dismiss
OPCD’s Observations.
