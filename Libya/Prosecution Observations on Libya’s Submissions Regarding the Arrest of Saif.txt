Submissions1
1. On 6 December 2011, this Chamber requested submissions from the Libyan
authorities regarding Saif Al‐Islam Gaddafi (“Saif Al‐Islam”), including (i)
whether he was arrested pursuant to the Court’s warrant of arrest; (ii) whether he
is being held incommunicado by the Libyan authorities; (iii) how to facilitate a
meeting between the Registrar and Saif Al‐Islam in order to seek his views on
being assigned counsel from the Court for purposes of proceedings before this
Court; (iv) how to arrange for an expert mandated by the Court to examine Saif
Al‐Islam to assess his physical and mental state; and (v) whether and when the
Libyan authorities intend to surrender Saif Al‐Islam to the Court.2
2. On 23 January 2012, the National Transitional Council (NTC), through its
coordinator for the ICC, submitted a response,3 in which it informed the
Chamber of the following: (i) Saif Al‐Islam was not arrested pursuant to the
arrest warrant issued by the Chamber. He was arrested by fighters from Zintan,
where he is currently being held as a prisoner of war, and arrangements are
being made to transfer him to Tripoli; (ii) Saif Al‐Islam is not being held
incommunicado. He has had access to family and human rights groups and
NGOs. He is refusing a lawyer and “has also declared very firmly that he will not
cooperate with any visitor from the ICC”; (iii) the NTC is willing to facilitate the
Registrar’s visit with Saif Al Islam at a mutually agreeable date and place; and
(iv) it is also willing to facilitate an expert’s visit to Saif Al‐Islam at a mutually
convenient time.

 Pursuant to Regulation 23bis(2) of the Regulations of the Court, the Prosecution files this document
confidential, Ex Parte, Prosecution, OPCD and Registry only, since it reveals information contained in the
observations submitted by the Libyan authorities, currently classified as confidential. 2

3. The NTC also explained that local magistrates are investigating Saif Al‐Islam for
murder, mass murder, torture, rape, financial corruption and stealing large sums
of money from public funds. The investigations are progressing but require
additional time. The NTC has stated that immediate compliance with the request
to surrender Saif Al‐Islam to the ICC would interfere with its ongoing
investigations and prosecution; therefore it sought postponement of surrender to
enable it to complete this process. 4 It noted its readiness to discuss the period of
time required to complete its investigation and prosecution.  
4. Finally, the NTC noted that it is considering whether to institute national
proceedings against Saif Al‐Islam for the conduct underlying this Court’s
pending charges.   While the NTC does not currently contest admissibility and
seeks only to postpone surrender, if a decision is made to pursue national
prosecution for this conduct the NTC will challenge admissibility before the
Court.   
5. The Prosecution takes note that Saif Al‐Islam is in custody in Zintan; that
arrangements are underway for his transfer to the Libyan authorities in Tripoli
and also that the Libyan authorities commit to discuss with the Court, the timing
of its pending judicial processes against him.    The Prosecution recalls in this
regard that any postponement requested pursuant to Article 94 shall be “for a
period of time agreed upon by the Court” and in any event “no longer than is
necessary to complete the relevant investigation and prosecution”.5

 The filing submitted by the NTC seeks postponement under Article 94, which addresses in subsection (1) that
if the “immediate execution of the request would interfere with” a domestic proceeding the requested State may
postpone execution “for a period of time agreed upon with the Court”. Article 89, which addresses “[r]equests
for surrender of persons to the Court”, also provides in subsection (4) that, if the suspect is being proceeded
against or serving a sentence for another crime, after a State agrees to grant a surrender request it may consult
with the Court on timing of compliance.

6. Because the NTC is not challenging the admissibility of the case before this
Court, the Prosecution’s investigations in relation to Saif Al‐Islam remain
ongoing.
