Background
Decision on the stay of proceedings
1. On 13 June 2008, the Trial Chamber issued the "Decision on the consequences
of non-disclosure of exculpatory materials covered by Article 54(3) (e)
agreements and the application to stay the prosecution of the accused,
together with certain other issues raised at the Status Conference on 10 June
2008"1
 ("Decision on the stay of proceedings"). In that decision, the Trial
Chamber ordered a stay on the proceedings2
 and scheduled a hearing for 24
June 2008 in order to consider the release of the accused.3
2. On 23 June 2008, the Prosecution filed the "Prosecution's Application for
leave to Appeal 'Decision on the consequences of non-disclosure of
exculpatory materials covered by Article 54(3)(e) agreements and the
application to stay the prosecution of the accused, together with certain other
issues raised at the Status Conference on 10 June 2008'"4
 ("Prosecution's
Request"). The Legal Representatives for the Victims a/0001/06 to a/0003/06
on 24 June 2008 filed the "Réponse à la demande du procureur de faire appel
contre la décision du 13 Juin 2008", supporting the Prosecution's Request.5
 On
27 June 2008, the Defence submitted the "Réponse de la Défense à la
Prosecution's Application for leave to Appeal 'Decision on the consequences
of non-disclosure of exculpatory materials covered by Article 54(3)(e)
agreements and the application to stay the prosecution of the accused,
together with certain other issues raised at the Status Conference on 10 June
2008', date du 23 juin 2008".6
 The Defence made no substantive submissions
on the Prosecution's Request.

3. On 2 July 2008, the Trial Chamber rendered the "Decision on the Prosecution's
Application for Leave to Appeal 'Decision on the consequences of nondisclosure of exculpatory materials covered by Article 54(3) (e) agreements and
the application to stay the prosecution of the accused'"/ granting the
Prosecution's Request.8
Order on the release of the accused
4. Following oral submissions on the release of the accused during the hearing of
24 June 2008 by the Defence,9
 the Legal Representatives of the Victims,10
 and
the Prosecution,11
 the Prosecution on 27 June 2008 filed the "Prosecution's
Submission on the Effect of the Application for Leave to Appeal the Decision
of the Trial Chamber to Stay the Proceedings on the Detention of Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo".12
 On the same day, the Defence submitted the "Observations
de la Défense sur la mise en liberté de M Thomas Lubanga",13
 and the Legal
Representatives for the Victims filed the "Observations communes des
représentants légaux des victims sur la demande de mise en liberté de
L'Accusé".14
5. On 2 July 2008, the Trial Chamber issued the "Decision on the release of Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo"15
 and ordered the unconditional and immediate release of the
accused.16
 The Trial Chamber furthermore decided that " ...this order shall not
be enforced until the expiry of the 5 day time-limit, and, furthermore, if an appeal is
filed within the 5 day time-limit against the order granting release and if a request is
made in the appeal for suspensive effect, the accused shall not leave detention until the

Appeals Chamber has resolved whether or not the effect of the order granting release is
to be suspended. "17
6. The same day, the Prosecution filed the "Prosecution's Appeal against
'Decision on the release of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo'",18
 and requested the
Appeals Chamber to grant suspensive effect to the appeal.19
7. On 7 July 2008, the Appeals Chamber granted the request for suspensive effect
of the Prosecution's Appeal against the Decision on the release of Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo.20
The Trial Chamber's suggestions and observations in relation to any application seeking
lifling of the stay of proceedings
8. During the hearing of 24 June 2008, the Trial Chamber proposed certain
suggestions and observations in relation to any application that may be made
in due course to lift the stay of the proceedings.21
 In particular, the Trial
Chamber stated that "...any application of this kind should occur and only occur
when the Prosecution is in a position to address to the extent that is feasible the
totality of the evidence that is covered by the Article 54(3)(e) agreements from all the
information providers ...",22
 and outlined, inter alia, the following four
observations:
(i) that any application to lift the stay should be addressed
comprehensively as part of a single application;23

(ii) that the Trial Chamber is unlikely to approve a system on the
review of the materials concerned that depends on its ability to
memorise large quantities of information which it is unable to
retain and study and thereby compare with the other evidence in
the case;24
(iii) that any proposal that the Trial Chamber should view the materials
that are protected by Article 54(3)(e) of the Rome Statute ("Statute")
will need to include conditions which enable it to explain in a
written decision by reference to the detail of the evidence it has
seen, an analysis of why it has reached any relevant conclusions,
and that any material shown to the Trial Chamber must be
available, if necessary, for review by the Appeals Chamber;25
 and
(iv) that it should not be assumed that the Trial Chamber will approve
summaries of the materials concerned.26
Filing on the discovery and examination of additional material
9. The Prosecution recalls that, on 24 June 2008, it filed the public version27
 of the
"Prosecution's further information regarding the discovery and examination
of additional material in the possession of the Prosecutor"28
 (24 June 2008
Filing). In that filing, the Prosecution informed the Trial Chamber:
(i) that an additional 19 documents obtained from the United Nations
("UN") were identified as falling within the scope of materials that
the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) must disclose pursuant to Article
67(2) and Rule 77;29

(ii) that 3 documents obtained from another information provider
under the condition that necessary measures will be taken to ensure
the confidentiality of the information were also identified as falling
within the OTP's disclosure obligations.30
Updated information on the scope of the Undisclosed Evidence
10. The Prosecution informs the Trial Chamber that the number of items forming
part of the Undisclosed31
 Evidence currently amounts to 204 items, as further
detailed below.
Undisclosed evidence obtained from the UN
11. As of its latest report to the Trial Chamber at the 10 June 2008 hearing, the
Prosecution was in possession of 154 items obtained from the UN pursuant to
Article 54(3)(e).32
 Since then, the UN have agreed to lift the Article 54(3)(e)
restrictions with respect of three documents.33
 These three documents can be
disclosed - in redacted form as requested by the UN34
 - to the Defence. One
further document has been found in the public domain and can be disclosed.
The number of UN items that fall within the range of Undisclosed Evidence
now amounts to 150 items.
12. In respect of the 19 documents that form part of the material recently
discovered by the OTP, the UN informed the Prosecution that 17 documents
30
 Ibid, at paras. 4 and 7.
31
 Or evidence that cannot be disclosed once the Defence has agreed to again receive disclosure materials.
32
 See ICC-01/04-01/06-T-89-ENG ET, page 5, lines 7 to 15. The two documents which the Prosecution
mentioned having disclosed on 9 June 2008 at the 10 June 2008 hearing are DRC-OTP-0043-0201 and DRCOTP-0058-0587.
33
 The documents concerned are DRC-OTP-0065-0030, DRC-OTP-0065-0063, and DRC-OTP-0065-0192.
34
 The Prosecution notes that the redactions to the documents DRC-OTP-0065-0663 and DRC-OTP-0065-0192
partially concern Rule 77 values of these documents. Whilst the Prosecution will continue to consult with the
UN to consent to unredact these portions, it provides the documents to the Trial Chamber in unredacted form.
No. ICC-01/04-01/06 7/20 11 July 2008

can be disclosed to the Defence.35
 Two documents fall within the range of
Undisclosed Evidence.36
13. Accordingly, the total number of UN materials that fall within the range of the
Undisclosed Evidence amounts to 152 items.37
Undisclosed evidence from information providers other than the United Nations
14. As of 24 June 2008,38
 the Prosecution informed the Trial Chamber that it had in
its possession 52 documents that were obtained from six information
providers other than the UN, and that three documents from one of those
information providers, recently discovered, needed to be added.39
15. From this range of 55 documents, the Prosecution can disclose two documents
to the Defence.40
 These documents formed part of the UPC website41
 and may
thus already be available to the Defence.
35
 16 out of these 17 documents would include minor redactions.
36
 Reference is made to Annex 4.
37
 Following a further internal review of the Undisclosed Evidence, the Prosecution draws the attention of the
Trial Chamber and the Defence to the fact that from the range of the initial 154 items, two documents (DRCOTP-0152-1487 and DRC-OTP-0112-0194) listed as undisclosed evidence are duplicates of each other and were
obtained from the same source. Additionally, upon closer scrutiny, the Prosecution has determined that six other
items (DRC-OTP-0005-0012, DRC-OTP-0005-0033, DRC-OTP-0006-0070, DRC-OTP-0016-0135, DRC-OTP0038-0909, and DRC-OTP-0152-0848) do not fall within the scope of either Article 67(2) or Rule 77. The
Prosecution will provide these materials to the Trial Chamber. Accordingly, if the Trial Chamber concurs with
the Prosecution's view that these seven items do not need to be disclosed to the Defence, the current number of
undisclosed items from the UN will actually be 146. Finally, the Prosecution is continuing consultations with the
UN, with a view to enabling disclosure of all documents directly to the Defence. The Prosecution will keep the
Trial Chamber informed of any further developments in this regard.
38
 See "Prosecution's provision of 32 documents and further information on documents that were obtained by the
Office of the Prosecutor pursuant to Article 54(3)(e) on the condition of confidentiality and solely for the
purpose of generating new evidence and that potentially contain evidence that falls under Article 67(2)", ICC01/04-01/06-1373, at para. 4, and para. 9(ii) above.
39
 Reference is made to paragraph 7 of the 24 June 2008 Filing.
40
 The undisclosed items are DRC-OTP-0037-0293 and DRC-OTP-0037-0285. The Prosecution is in possession
of copies stemming from the UPC website which are not subject to Article 54(3)(e) restrictions. These copies
(DRC-OTP-0193-0212 and DRC-OTP-0193-0457) have exactly the same content as the two items of
undisclosed evidence, and can be disclosed immediately. Accordingly, the two items do not, in the Prosecution's
view, need to be disclosed to the Defence, and the current number of undisclosed items from information
providers other than the UN is actually 53.
41
 Reference is made to paragraph 8 of the 24 June 2008 Filing.
No. ICC-01/04-01/06 8/20 11 July 2008

16. Additionally, the Prosecution has established that it already42
 disclosed a
copy of the relevant Rule 77 portion of one of the items forming part of the
Undisclosed Evidence.43
 However, for the sake of full transparency, the
Prosecution will still proceed to provide this item to the Trial Chamber.
17. Accordingly, the total number of non-UN materials that fall within the range
of the Undisclosed Evidence amounts as of the date of this filing to 52 items.
Information on the providers and the nature of the documents
18. As requested by the Trial Chamber,44
 the Prosecution provides the Trial
Chamber with information on the providers and the nature of the documents
concerned.
19. The information is detailed in the attached confidential - ex parte - Prosecution
only Annex.45
 The Prosecution informs the Trial Chamber that the information
providers have for reasons spelled out below limited the disclosure of this
information to the Trial Chamber only.46
42
 On 14 September 2006.
43
 The document concerned is DRC-OTP-0021-0685. The document which was disclosed on 14 September 2006
is DRC-OTP-0107-0223. See ICC-01/04-01/06-444-Conf-Anx. Whilst the Prosecution will provide this item to
the Trial Chamber, it in the Prosecution's view does not require review by the Trial Chamber nor disclosure to
the Defence.

Arrangements for the review of items by the Judges
Proposal by the UN
20. Following the hearing of 24 June 2008, the OTP explored with the UN
procedures that accommodate the concerns that the Trial Chamber expressed
during that hearing and adhere to its observations.
21. The result of these consultations is contained in three letters of the UN, two
letters dated 3 July 2008, and one letter dated 8 July 2008.47
 Annex 2 concerns
33 items, Annex 3 concerns another 122 items and Annex 4 concerns the 19
items as referred to in paragraph 9(i) above. The letters cover all UN items that
form part of the Undisclosed Evidence.
22. Summarised, and without prejudice to the exact terms of the UN letters, the
UN proposes the following procedure:
(i) The Trial Chamber can be provided copies immediately of all UN
items forming part of the Undisclosed Evidence which it can retain
for its review in chambers or otherwise in closed session and ex
parte. The Trial Chamber can review the items concerned in
chambers, and can make notes if it so wishes as it reviews the
items.48
(ii) In the event that the Trial Chamber considers that any information
contained in the UN items must be made available to the accused
and the Defence, the proposal foresees a range of possible
remedies: In the first instance, the provision of summaries, which
the Trial Chamber will be able to assess against the items shown to
it so as to verify their accuracy and adequacy. Alternatively, should
47
 The UN letters are attached as Annexes 2 to 4.
48
 In addition, the Prosecution reiterates its undertaking that it will provide for English translations of the
relevant portions of the French documents, as soon as possible and once they are available.
No. ICC-01/04-01/06 10/20 11 July 2008
ICC-01/04-01/06-1431 11-07-2008 10/20 VW T
PURL: https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/5c387f/
the provision of such summaries be deemed inadequate, the UN
envisages the possibility of making such items or information
contained therein available to the accused and his Defence by other
means, including subject to such protective measures that may be
permissible under the Rome Statute and the Rules of Procedure
and Evidence.
(iii) Upon completion of the entire process, given the lack of procedural
certainty at this stage as to the procedure that may be followed on
appeal, the letters foresee two possibilities:
(a) If the Appeals Chamber has the opportunity to decide on
the matter before the Trial Chamber reviews the items and it
is able to provide for procedural clarity, including
acceptance of the same conditions, then the copies of the
items concerned together with any notes created by the Trial
Chamber could be retained indefinitely by the Trial
Chamber for eventual review by the Appeals Chamber, as
and when this may be required.
(b) Alternatively, if the Appeals Chamber does not have the
opportunity to decide on the matter before the Trial
Chamber completes its review of the items, the UN asks that,
upon completion of the review, the Judges of the Trial
Chamber return all copies of the items and that redactions
are applied to any portion of their notes that contain
verbatim extracts of the items or which paraphrase the
contents thereof. At the same time, assurance is provided in
the letter that the UN would thereafter consent to the
No. ICC-01/04-01/06 11/20 11 July 2008
ICC-01/04-01/06-1431 11-07-2008 11/20 VW T
PURL: https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/5c387f/
Appeals Chamber reviewing the items tinder the same
conditions.49
23. Accordingly, the Prosecution is in a position to immediately provide all UN
documents that form part of the Undisclosed Evidence to the Trial Chamber.
24. The Prosecution submits that this suggested procedure accommodates the
concerns that the Trial Chamber expressed during the hearing on 24 June
2008. In case of doubt, the letters emphasise the preparedness of the UN to
provide any clarification or explanation as may be required with a view to
constructively resolving the matter.
25. The Prosecution submits, in particular, that the proposal includes conditions
which will enable the Trial Chamber to explain in a written decision by
reference to the detail of the evidence it has seen, an analysis of why it has
reached any relevant conclusions. The Prosecution submits that the Trial
Chamber could in its written decision provide, pursuant to Article 64(6)(c), for
the protection of confidential information.50
Other information providers
26. The Prosecution refers to paragraphs 6 to 11 of the 3 June 2008 "Prosecution's
provision of 32 documents and further information on documents that were
obtained by the Office of the Prosecutor pursuant to Article 54(3)(e) on the
condition of confidentiality and solely for the purpose of generating new
evidence and that potentially contain evidence that falls under Article 67(2)"51
49
 It should be noted that under option 22. (iii)(b) the Appeals Chamber would equally have all the elements of
the information before it and would be able to proceed to review the items as well as the notes of the Judges of
the Trial Chamber, with any accompanying cross-references they may contain to sections of the items that had
been previously cited verbatim or paraphrased.
50
 E.g. such decision could identify the aspects of the case the documents relate to, the exonerating category or
Rule 77 information within which the information fell and any appropriate remedy to be provided to the accused.

(3 June 2008 Filing). Since then, and in light of the concerns raised by the Trial
Chamber in the course of the 24 June 2008 hearing, the OTP has explored
further alternative arrangements with the respective information providers.
27. The Prosecution provides the Trial Chamber with the following updated
information:
NGO "REDACTED"-"REDACTED"
28. The first information provider52
 is the Non-Governmental Organisation
("NGO") "REDACTED" - "REDACTED". 22 documents53
 forming part of the
Undisclosed Evidence originate from that NGO. The Prosecution is now in a
position to provide these 22 documents unredacted to the Trial Chamber.54
29. However, because REDACTED is REDACTED, revealing to the Defence
and/or the accused REDACTED, REDACTED. REDACTED has in fact, for
those reasons, REDACTED. Accordingly, it is requested that REDACTED is
not provided to the Defence and/or the accused.
30. Should the Trial Chamber decide that the REDACTED documents need to be
disclosed to the Defence, the Prosecution will recommend the provision of
summaries, where applicable in redacted form, REDACTED.
52
 Reference is made to para. 6 of the 3 June 2008 Filing.
33
 The two documents reference to in paragraph 15 above form part of these 22 documents. In theory, the copies
of these items which are not subject to Article 54(3)(e) restrictions, can be disclosed immediately. The Defence,
however, has informed the Prosecution that it currently is not prepared to receive any materials from the
Prosecution.

NGO "REDACTED" - "REDACTED"
31. The second information provider55
 is the NGO "REDACTED" -
"REDACTED". One document forming part of the Undisclosed Evidence
originates from that NGO. On 9 June 2008, the Prosecution provided the Trial
Chamber with the document concerned, in redacted form,56
 REDACTED. The
Prosecution now provides the unredacted document to the Trial Chamber.57
32. However, REDACTED.58
 For that reason and also REDACTED, REDACTED
has declined to disclose its identity to the Defence and/or the accused, and
thus also to the public.
NGO "REDACTED" - "REDACTED"
33. The third information provider59

document concerned in redacted form,69
 REDACTED. REDACTED in the
meantime has agreed that the Prosecution may disclose its identity to the Trial

43. REDACTED has informed the OTP that it is currently REDACTED to what

to disclose its identity to the Defence and/or the accused, and thus also to the
public.
Conclusions
45. In conclusion and in consideration of the above, once the Trial Chamber has
received all the unredacted UN documents71
 and all the unredacted NGO
documents, it will have at its disposal for review all items that form part of the
Undisclosed Evidence. All items will be provided in unredacted form.
46. In addition, the UN have agreed that - where the Trial Chamber finds that the
items or information therein should be made available to the Defence and the
accused, that they can either receive a summary of the disclosure value of the
items, the adequacy of which the Trial Chamber would be able to assess, or,

that they are otherwise provided with the items or information therein by
other means - combined as appropriate with such protective measures as are
permissible under the Statute and the Rules.
47. Furthermore, should the Trial Chamber decide that the documents from the
NGOs need to be disclosed, the disclosure of 31 documents - in redacted
form not impacting on the disclosure values - to the Defence and to the
accused, out of 52, is already possible. There is a reasonable prospective that,
if so requested, the information providers can agree to disclose most of the
remaining 21 documents.
48. Should the Trial Chamber assess that a document from an NGO needs to be
disclosed to the Defence and/or the accused, the Prosecution submits that it
will return to the NGO concerned with the request and seek ad hoc solutions,
taking into account the strong concerns expressed by the NGOs on the
REDACTED and REDACTED.
49. Against this background, the Prosecution submits that it has effectively
complied with the conditions set by the Trial Chamber to lift the stay of
proceedings as detailed in paragraph 8 above:
(i) The Trial Chamber can review the items concerned in chambers,
and can make notes as it reviews the items;
(ii) The Trial Chamber will be able to explain in a written decision by
reference to the detail of evidence it has seen the reasons for its
decision, thus providing for review by the Appeals Chamber,
where necessary ;72
 and

(iii) The suggestion in respect of the items originating from the UN
envisages a range of possible remedies for Defence and the accused
beyond the provision of summaries.73
50. The Prosecution submits that even if for 21 documents some of the remaining
information providers are not at this time able to provide their consent for
disclosure to the Defence and the accused, the Trial Chamber's ability to
determine whether or not the non-disclosure of this potentially exculpatory
material constitutes a breach of the accused's right to a fair trial74
 is not
affected.
Impact on the order to release the accused
51. The "Decision on the release of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo" is based solely75
 on
the order to stay the proceedings against him. Accordingly, in the event that
the Trial Chamber orders the lift of the stay of proceedings, the decision on
the release lacks its basis and consequently needs to be revoked.
Confidential - ex parte - Prosecution only classification
52. In light of the information that is provided on the NGOs and their position,
the Prosecution files the present submission as "Confidential - ex parte -
Prosecution only".
53. The Prosecution will file a public redacted version in due course; where
necessary, it will also file a "Confidential - Prosecution and Defence only"
version.
