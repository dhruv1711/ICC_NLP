The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, pursuant to his authority under
Article 61(3)(a) of the Rome Statute (Statute) charges
Thomas LUBANGA DYILO
with WAR CRIMES, as set forth below:
THE ACCUSED
1. Thomas LUBANGA DYILO was born on 29 December 1960 in Jiba, in the
then République du Congo. He is of Hema-Gegere ethnicity.
2. Thomas LUBANGA DYILO is the President of the Union des Patriotes
Congolais (UPC) and was the Commander-in-Chief of its former military
wing, the Forces Patriotiques pour la Libération du Congo (FPLC). He has a
university degree in psychology.
3. In late 1999/early 2000, soon after Thomas LUBANGA DYILO became
involved in politics, he was elected Member of the Assembly of the Province
of Ituri. In early 2001, he became the Deputy National Secretary for Youth and
Sports of the Front de Libération du Congo (FLC). Later, Thomas LUBANGA
DYILO was appointed Defence Minister of the Rassemblement Congolais
pour la Démocratie - Kisangani / Mouvement de Libération (RCD-K/ML), a
position he held until about February 2002.

4. On 15 September 2000, Thomas LUBANGA DYILO, together with others,
mostly of Hema-Gegere ethnicity, founded the UPC, a self-declared "politicalmilitary movement". Thomas LUBANGA DYILO was appointed its first
President, a position he maintained at all times relevant to the present charges,
and up until today.
5. In mid September 2002 at the latest, Thomas LUBANGA DYILO, together
with others, founded the FPLC as the military wing of the UPC. Upon its
creation, he became its Commander-in-Chief and held this position
throughout the period relevant to the present charges.
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
6. All acts alleged in this Document Containing the Charges occurred between 1
July 2002 and 31 December 2003 in the district of Ituri, Province Orientale,
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
7. The crimes occurred in the context of an armed conflict not of an international
character.
8. At all times relevant to the present charges, Thomas LUBANGA DYILO was
aware of the existence of an armed conflict in Ituri.
BACKGROUND
9. From its foundation, the UPC, from its headquarters in Bunia, developed into
a structured political-military movement in the region of Ituri. Beginning in
No.: ICC-01/04-01/06 28 August 2006
ICC-01/04-01/06-356-Anx2 28-08-2006 3/24 SL PT

August 2002, the UPC gradually expanded its influence throughout Ituri,
allowing Thomas LUBANGA DYILO, who had successfully lobbied a range
of actors for political, financial and military support, to form a UPC-controlled
Government in September 2002. By the end of 2002, from its seat in Bunia, the
UPC controlled much of the district of Ituri, resulting in Thomas LUBANGA
DYILO becoming the counterpart for regional, national and international
actors with an interest in the conflict in Ituri.
10. The daily work of the UPC Government was carried out through a
"Secrétariat Général". The various portfolios such as "Interior", "Finances
and Budget", "Justice", "Foreign Affairs" and "Economy" were assigned to
UPC "national secretaries", equivalent to the positions of ministers.
11. Thomas LUBANGA DYILO, as President of the UPC, at all times relevant to
the present charges, fully exercised the powers he was entrusted with by the
UPC Statute. In practice, his powers went even beyond what was envisioned
in it, making Thomas LUBANGA DYILO the ultimate authority within the
UPC, and the recipient of merely "technical advice" from the "national
secretaries", whom he appointed, suspended, dismissed and expelled.
Consequently, Thomas LUBANGA DYILO fully controlled the UPC and its
members.
12. Over time, the UPC became an organization which only exceptionally
included non-Hema. Under the direction of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO, the
UPC aimed at establishing Hema dominance and control in Ituri by military
means and by way of violence. The UPC, under Thomas LUBANGA
DYILO's leadership, supported violent ethnic division and targeted the nonHema population in Ituri.

PURL: https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/e2fa01/
13. In mid-summer 2002 at the latest, and in order to achieve the aims of the UPC,
Thomas LUBANGA DYILO, together with other UPC leaders and FPLC
commanders, defined a strategy to engage in the armed conflict against the
non-Hema militias, in particular the Lendu militia which later on emerged as
the Lendu-dominated Front Nationaliste Integrationniste (FNI), and to spread
violence amongst the Lendu civilians and civilian members of other ethnic
groups associated with the Lendu in Ituri.
14. From its inception, the UPC had soldiers, arms and ammunition at its
disposal. In September 2002, Thomas LUBANGA DYILO, as President of the
UPC, founded the FPLC as its military wing. From the beginning, the FPLC -
commonly referred to simply as "the UPC" - was mainly comprised of Hema.
By incorporating, inter alia, members of the pre-existing Hema militia as
soldiers and officers, the FPLC shortly after its creation had several thousands
of troops in arms, including a significant number of children under the age of
fifteen years.
15. From the formation of the FPLC, and at all times relevant to the present
charges, Thomas LUBANGA DYILO, who at the end of 2000 had received
military training in Uganda, was the FPLC Commander-in-Chief.
16. Within weeks of its creation, Thomas LUBANGA DYILO, together with
others, established organized military structures within the FPLC. These
structures included a General Staff, with a Chief of the General Staff and two
deputies, one in charge of military operations and organisation and the other
in charge of administration and logistics. Staff officers for personnel,
intelligence, operations, logistics and civilian-military relations reported to the
General Staff. Resembling the organisation of well-structured armies, the
FPLC included a number of military sectors. Each sector was comprised of

PURL: https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/e2fa01/
hierarchically structured military units, including brigades and battalions,
commanded by trained military officers. The FPLC was able to adjust its
structure in response to specific requirements of its military objectives, and
repeatedly did so.
17. The FPLC had extensive means of communication at its disposal, such as
satellite phones, mobile phones, Motorola radios and other radios. These
means of communication allowed FPLC officers to maintain contact with each
other, to report to Thomas LUBANGA DYILO, and permitted effective
ordering and reporting within the FPLC chain-of-command. In addition, the
means of transportation available to the FPLC allowed its commanders and
Thomas LUBANGA DYILO to deploy throughout Ituri, and enabled Thomas
LUBANGA DYILO's immediate subordinate commanders to report to him in
person at the FPLC headquarters on a regular basis. Thus, Thomas
LUBANGA DYILO was in a position to exercise command and control over
subordinate military units on a permanent basis, and to stay informed about
the general situation in Ituri, in particular about FPLC military operations and
the situation in the FPLC military training camps.
18. Thomas LUBANGA DYILO, at all times relevant to the present charges,
exercised authority over the FPLC, both de hire and de facto, which he
demonstrated by, inter alia, issuing orders, instructions and directives to
subordinate commanders.
19. During the second half of 2002 and throughout 2003, the FPLC under the
command of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO repeatedly conducted large-scale
military operations in Ituri, predominately against the Lendu militia forces,
Lendu civilians, and, after its creation in December 2002, against the LenduNo.: ICC-01/04-01/06 28 August 2006

dominated FNI. In these military operations, the FPLC repeatedly used
children under the age of fifteen years to participate actively in hostilities.
MODE OF LIABILITY
20. Thomas LUBANGA DYILO committed the crimes of enlisting and
conscripting children under the age of fifteen years and using them to
participate actively in hostilities as co-perpetrator, jointly with other FPLC
officers and UPC members and supporters, including, inter alia, the FPLC
officers named below.
21. Based on the intent shared by Thomas LUBANGA DYILO and the other joint
perpetrators to enlist and conscript children under the age of fifteen years and
to use them in hostilities, he, in pursuing the common goal, coordinated their
efforts, and controlled the execution of the common plan.
22. Thomas LUBANGA DYILO and the other joint perpetrators contributed to
the common plan according to their respective functions and powers within
the FPLC military structure and the UPC. Thomas LUBANGA DYILO, as a
key actor, in his position as both President of the UPC and Commander-inChief of the FPLC, played an overall coordinating role by providing the
organizational, infrastructural and logistical framework: He appointed the
higher ranks within the FPLC, thus ensuring the existence and coherence of
the military structure into which the children were incorporated. In line with
the UPC Statute, Thomas LUBANGA DYILO guaranteed the continuity of
the UPC and the FPLC by securing their financial means. Thus, he made it
possible for the FPLC to recruit children, to set up FPLC military camps and to
militarily train the children. Furthermore, Thomas LUBANGA DYILO

PURL: https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/e2fa01/
repeatedly negotiated the provision of weapons and other military equipment,
including such as would be used by the children in hostilities.
23. Thomas LUBANGA DYILO lent his authority to the common goal in a
variety of ways: He repeatedly inspected various FPLC training camps to
encourage children and prepare them for combat. In addition, Thomas
LUBANGA DYILO maintained close contact with those subordinate FPLC
commanders known as being active in recruiting, training and using children
in hostilities, including, inter alia, the Deputy Chief-of-Staff Bosco
NTAGANDA, commander TCHALIGONZA, and Deputy National Secretary
for Defence Yves KAHWA PANGA. Furthermore, he encouraged Hema
families to provide their children to the FPLC. Moreover, by his own use of
children as bodyguards, Thomas LUBANGA DYILO set an example about
the ways in which children could be used.
24. In doing so, Thomas LUBANGA DYILO, in his leadership role, coordinated
the efforts of the other FPLC officers, some of whom, as co-perpetrators,
contributed to the common goal by recruiting children under the age of fifteen
years themselves or through subordinates. Others transported the children or
arranged for their transportation to the FPLC military training camps, whilst
others provided military training to the children and/or equipped them with
weapons. Then, the FPLC combat unit commanders placed the children into
their respective military units and ordered them into combat. Often, the same
FPLC officers commanded the FPLC military training camps, provided the
military training, and ordered the children to participate in FPLC military
operations.

CHARGES
ENLISTING AND CONSCRIPTING CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF FIFTEEN
YEARS AND USING THEM TO PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY IN HOSTILITIES
FPLC policy of enlisting and conscripting children under the age of fifteen years
and using them to participate actively in hostilities
25. With the foundation of the UPC, Thomas LUBANGA DYILO started to
pursue his political, military and economic aims by using Hema members of
pre-existing militia groups and selected trained officers, including some
officers of other ethnic and geographical origins. Soon, the UPC recruited in
large numbers men, women and children and provided them with extensive
military training.
26. Prior to the foundation of the FPLC, and since 2001 at the latest, the UPC
actively recruited children under the age of fifteen years in significant
numbers and subjected them to military training in its military training camp
in Sota, amongst other places. Thomas LUBANGA DYILO was directly
involved in these recruitment activities, including forcible recruitment. The
compound of his house in Bunia was used as a distribution centre for sending
new recruits, including children under the age of fifteen years, to various UPC
military training centres.
27. After the foundation of the FPLC, throughout the remainder of 2002 and
throughout 2003, Thomas LUBANGA DYILO, in pursuing the UPC policy,
jointly with a variety of high-level and mid-level subordinate FPLC
commanders, continued to enlist and conscript children systematically and in
large numbers, including children under the age of fifteen years, to militarily

train them, and to use them to participate actively in hostilities. FPLC senior
commanders repeatedly participated directly in the recruitment of children
under the age of fifteen years.
28. Thomas LUBANGA DYILO continued the earlier practice that each Hema
family contribute to the war efforts by providing children to the Hema militia.
Accordingly, Hema families brought forward children, including children
under the age of fifteen years, who were enlisted by the FPLC. As a result, the
number of children amongst the recruits in the FPLC's training camps was
significant.
29. In addition, both the UPC and the FPLC from August 2002 onwards, launched
repeated campaigns to recruit children, including by force. The features of
these campaigns included, inter alia: (a) making available pick-up cars to
specific "émissaires" who were promised money for successful recruitment;
(b) senior FPLC military commanders organizing the recruitment of children
by participating in meetings with the local Hema communities, including in
Bunia, during which gatherings they ordered Hema families to enrol their
children in the FPLC, threatening to recruit the children by force; and (c) the
imposition of a special, almost weekly, tax on all civilians, irrespective of their
ethnic background by the UPC Government in Ituri, led and controlled by
Thomas LUBANGA DYILO, with the particular purpose of funding the
military training of children and in order to facilitate the coordinated efforts in
recruiting children.

Pattern of the FPLC in enlisting and conscripting children under the age of fifteen
years and using them to participate actively in hostilities
Enlisting children
30. The UPC, and the FPLC from its foundation and throughout 2002 and 2003,
admitted children under the age of fifteen years into their ranks. These
children included children who by their physical appearance were manifestly
under the age of fifteen years.
31. For various reasons, these children, mostly boys but also girls, in high
numbers either "voluntarily" joined the FPLC or were made available by their
parents. The willingness of the children to join the FPLC was determined by,
inter alia, the desire for revenge of orphans whose families were killed or
allegedly killed by the militias opposing the FPLC, the wish to acquire social
status, and/or the coercive circumstances in which the children found
themselves, such as basic, urgent needs for protection and food. The FPLC
exploited these circumstances in implementing its policy of enlisting children
under the age of fifteen years.
Conscripting children
32. During 2002 and 2003 and throughout Iruri, FPLC commanders forcibly
recruited children, including children who by their physical appearance were
manifestly under the age of fifteen years. FPLC forces systematically
abducted mainly boys, but also girls, and forcibly incorporated them into the
ranks of the FPLC.

PURL: https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/e2fa01/
Using children to participate actively in hostilities
33. Immediately after their recruitment, the children, both boys and girls, were
forced to march, in some instances long distances, or were driven, in usually
larger groups, by FPLC soldiers in trucks and other vehicles to FPLC training
camps in Ituri.
34. The training camps included the training camps in Centrale, Mandro,
Rwampara, Irumu and Bule. Almost all training camps were located close to
Thomas LUBANGA DYILO's permanent headquarters in Bunia: Centrale is
located to the North of Bunia, at a distance of 12 km. Mandro is situated to the
East of Bunia, at a distance of 15 km. Rwampara is located to the Southwest of
Bunia, at a distance of 13 km. Irumu is located to the Southwest of Bunia, at
an aerial distance of about 40 km and at a road distance of 55 km. Bule is
located to the Northeast of Bunia, at an aerial distance of about 55 km and at a
road distance of 110 km.
35. It was common practice that the day following their arrival at the military
training camps, the organised and systematic military training of the children
by FPLC officers began. The aim of the training was to prepare the children
for active participation in hostilities. Training lasted up to two months and
included daily full-day practical physical exercises like saluting, marching,
running, and taking positions. In addition, the children received intensive
training in the use of firearms. The instructors sought to boost the morale of
the children by compelling them to sing aggressive military songs, including
songs disparaging or threatening the Lendu.

PURL: https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/e2fa01/
36. The children in the FPLC training camps were subjected to strict military
discipline. A detailed system of severe sanctions for misconduct was imposed
on them, including beatings, detention and execution.
37. FPLC senior commanders regularly visited FPLC training camps where
children under the age of fifteen years were trained. Thomas LUBANGA
DYILO himself repeatedly visited the training camps. He saw the children
being trained, spoke to them, and encouraged their fighting morale.
38. Regularly, after completion of the training, FPLC commanders provided each
of the children with a military uniform and a personal weapon, usually a gun.
39. Soon after the completion of the basic military training, FPLC commanders,
including senior ones, regularly ordered children, boys and girls, including
those under the age of fifteen years, to fight at the frontlines. FPLC
commanders gave the children instructions to kill all Lendu, without any
instruction to differentiate between soldiers and civilians. Reluctant children,
fearing to get killed during battle, were forced to participate in the hostilities
by threats of execution. Afraid for their lives, they obeyed the orders, and
repeatedly killed Lendu, both soldiers and civilians. Whilst fighting at the
frontlines, many children fighting for the FPLC were killed. Others were
seriously wounded.
40. Furthermore, it was common for children to be used by FPLC military
commanders, including Thomas LUBANGA DYILO, as bodyguards. Their
tasks included, inter alia, guaranteeing the commanders' close physical
protection, including during military deployments. Furthermore, the children
used as bodyguards were ordered to protect the headquarters of the General
Staff in Bunia and the commanders' private houses. The number of children

guarding FPLC commanders depended on the commander's rank, and ranged
from one child to more than ten children, both boys and girls.
Individual cases
Enlistment of the ten-year-old REDACTED in late 2002, and using him and other
children under the age of fifteen years to participate actively in the FPLC attack on
Lipri in February and March 2003
41. REDACTED, born in REDACTED, in about December 2002 met FPLC soldiers
in REDACTED. Since Lendu soldiers had allegedly killed his mother in Lipri,
he agreed to follow the FPLC troops to receive military training and to fight
the Lendu. FPLC troops brought him to the FPLC military camp in
REDACTED, where he joined some sixty children of his age, mainly boys but
also girls.
42. On the first day, all new arrivals were provided with military uniforms and
weapons, including guns. The daily military training for both boys and girls
started the following day, under the command of FPLC commander
TSHITSHA. In addition to basic physical training, the children were taught
how to use their weapons.
43. Soon, REDACTED. In February 2003, REDACTED acting pursuant to
TSHITSHA's orders, REDACTED participated in the FPLC attack on Lipri.

44. The day after the attack, the FPLC troops under the command of TSHITSHA
were inspected by Chief-of-Staff Floribert KISEMBO and Deputy Chief-ofStaff Bosco NTAGANDA at the FPLC headquarters in Mongbwalu. Bosco
NTAGANDA ordered the troops to re-attack Lipri and told the boys of
REDACTED's age to follow their commanders to the frontline. In complying
with the order, REDACTED and the other children fought in Lipri.
Conscription by abduction of the eleven-year-old REDACTED and REDACTED in
early 2003 in REDACTED
45. REDACTED, born in REDACTED, and REDACTED, born in REDACTED,
were abducted in early 2003 by FPLC troops from their parents' house in the
village of REDACTED. In fear of being killed, neither of their families offered
any resistance. On the same day, REDACTED, the FPLC abducted many
other children, boys and girls, of REDACTED's age.
46. REDACTED and REDACTED, together with the other abducted children,
were transported in a vehicle to the FPLC military training camp in
REDACTED. They were closely monitored by FPLC soldiers in order to
prevent their escape.
47. In REDACTED, the children were divided into groups of about fifty new
recruits, comprised of both adult soldiers and children. The children included
boys and girls.
48. The next day, the daily military training started. It was mainly of practical
nature, and included saluting, marching and climbing. In addition, the
recruits were taught how to shoot with firearms.

49. Thomas LUBANGA DYILO repeatedly inspected the FPLC training camp in
REDACTED. During these visits, he addressed the new recruits. On one
occasion, Thomas LUBANGA DYILO told the children to closely follow the
trainers' instructions in order to be in a position to attack and kill the enemies.
50. After about two months, once the military training was completed,
REDACTED, REDACTED and the other trained children were supplied with a
military uniform and a gun. In addition, six magazines of ammunition were
provided to each child.

distributed to the military camps in Centrale, Mandro and Bogoro.
REDACTED and other children were deployed in Centrale, where they were
visited by Deputy Chief-of-Staff Bosco NTAGANDA. Bosco NTAGANDA
had come to address the FPLC troops and bolster their morale prior to the
FPLC attack on Lipri.
53. Acting pursuant to the order of FPLC commander KASANGAKI,
REDACTED, together with other children and adult soldiers, participated in
the FPLC attack on Lipri. The fighting lasted for about four hours and

87. The children's experiences are representative of those of other children
enlisted, conscripted and used by the FPLC. These experiences are also
consistent with the scientific research showing that children who have
suffered trauma become prone to psychological disorders which contribute to
their alienation and add to the problems in their society.
