Background
1. On 13 September 20071
, the former defense counsel of Mr. Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo, Maître Jean Flamme ("the Applicant"), filed a "Motion by
Former Counsel for Leave to File Written Corrigenda to Oral Argument"2
 before
the Trial Chamber. In this filing, the applicant requested leave to file a written
corrigendum to his oral argument before the Pre-Trial Chamber during the
confirmation hearing of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo on 9 November 2006.3
2. On 3 October 2007, the Prosecution filed a "Prosecution's reply to motion
for leave to file written corrigenda to oral argument"4
, which requested the
motion to be dismissed on the ground that the Trial Chamber was without
jurisdiction to hear the motion. On 11 October 2007, the Applicant filed a
response to the Prosecution's reply with the Trial Chamber, wherein he stated
inter alia "...given that the Court has now been made aware of the true position
intended by Counsel, and given no motion to strike has been filed by the
Prosecution, it is respectfully submitted that no further action is required".5

 The Registry notified this filing in accordance with Regulation of the Court 31 on 24 September 2007.

3. On 12 October 2007, the Trial Chamber dismissed the applicant's motion
on jurisdictional grounds, stating: "the oral submissions which are sought to be
corrected were made by former counsel during the hearing on the confirmation
of charges before Pre-Trial Chamber I."

4. On 30 October 2007 the applicant filed a "Motion by Former Counsel for
Leave to File Written Corrigenda to Oral Argument before the Pre-Trial
Chamber" (the motion) with Pre-Trial Chamber I wherein the Applicant seeks as
relief that the Pre-Trial Chamber "note the corrigenda as set out in the present
motion".7
The Position of the Prosecution
5. To the extent that the Applicant's motion can be construed as a request to
amend or alter the transcript of proceedings before the Pre-Trial Chamber on
November 9, 2006, the Prosecution opposes the application on the ground that
such a remedy is not available.
6. The Applicant does not seek an amendment of the transcript on the basis
that the transcription of the proceedings is inaccurate. Indeed, the Applicant

ICC-01/04-01/06 -1025 13-11-2007 3/5 SL T
confirms the accuracy of the transcription of his submissions to the Pre-Trial
Chamber on November 9, 2006. Instead, the Applicant seeks, almost a year later,
an amendment to the transcript to reflect an appreciably different factual
assertion. Precedents from the ad hoc tribunals support the principle that a
Chamber has inherent authority to order the amendment of a transcript to accord
with transcription or translation errors.8
 However, these authorities do not
extend so far as to support the Applicant's extraordinary proposition that, as a
result of a Rule of Professional conduct,9
 this Chamber has authority to reopen
the proceeding and order a material alteration to the Applicant's submissions,
elevens months after the fact. Indeed, the Prosecution submits that the remedy
requested by the Applicant seems to run contrary to the intent and spirit of
Regulation 27(2) of the Regulations of Court, which codifies the importance of
accurate transcripts of hearings.
7. It is the Prosecution's position that the remedy requested by the Applicant
cannot be granted. It is submitted that, notwithstanding the ostensible
8
 The Prosecution refers to the following examples in the jurisprudence of the ad hoc tribunals that address the issue of
alterations to records of proceedings wherein the changes allowed ex post facto were merely typographic or translation
related. The Prosecutor v. Ferdinand Nahimana Jean-Boscoarayagwiza Hassan Ngeze (30 October 2006) Decision on the
Appellant Jean-Bosco Barayagwiza's Corrigendum Motion of 5. UN ICT (App)(Rwa), Dec 2006 (No. ICTR-99-52-A); The
Prosecutor v. Elizaphan Ntakirumtimana and Gérard Ntakirutimana (24 June 2004) Decision on the Defence Motion to
Strike Annex B from the Prosecution Response Brief and for the Re-Certification of the Record. UN ICT (App)(Rwa), June
2004 (No. ICTR-96-10-A and ICTR-96-17-A); The Prosecutor v. Zeljko Mejakic et al., Case No. IT-02-65-AR1 Ibis. 1 Decision
on Joint Defense Motion for Enlargement of Time to File Appellants' Brief, 30 August 2005.
" It is the position of Prosecution that authority to amend a transcript of a hearing to account for typographical or
translation errors is derived from the Chamber's inherent authority over its own proceedings. The Applicant has cited no
authority that a Rule of professional conduct for counsel can grant a Chamber substantive, remedial powers.

explanation given by the Applicant, the transcript of the proceedings must
remain as it is - the authoritative record of the exact words spoken by the
Applicant before the Pre-Trial Chamber on the date in question.
Order Requested
8. The Prosecution requests that the Pre-Trial Chamber dismiss the
Applicant's motion.
