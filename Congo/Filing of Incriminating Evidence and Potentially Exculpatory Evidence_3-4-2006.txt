Background
1. The Prosecution refers to the "interim system of disclosure" as set out by
the Pre-Trial Chamber's (public) "Decision Requesting Observations of the
Prosecution and the Duty Counsel for the Defence on the System of
Disclosure and Establishing an Interim System of Disclosure" of 23 March
2006 (23 March 2006 Decision)/ reinforced by the Pre-Trial Chamber's
(public) "Decision Requesting Further Observations from the Prosecution
and the Duty Counsel for the Defence on the System of Disclosure" of 27
March 2006 (27 March 2006 Decision).2
Preliminary observations in respect to Article 67(2) of the Rome Statute and
disclosure of potentially exonerating evidence
2. On 6 April 2006, the Prosecution will, as requested by the Pre-Trial
Chamber,3
 comprehensively submit its observations on the system of
disclosure the Prosecution considers envisaged by the respective
provisions in the Rome Statute (Statute) and the Rules of Procedure and
Evidence (Rules).4
' See 23 March 2006 Decision, at pages 5 to 7.
2
 See 27 March 2006 Decision, at pages 5 and 6.
3
 See 23 March 2006 Decision, at page 5, and 27 March 2006 Decision, at page 5.
4
 The Prosecution will also address its concerns in respect of a number of practical aspects of disclosure as
currently set out in the Pre-Trial Chamber's "interim system of disclosure."

3. For the time being,5
 the Prosecution informs the Pre-Trial Chamber about
the following:
(i) In respect of Article 67(2) of the Statute, the Prosecution does
not consider itself being legally obliged to disclose at this stage of
the proceedings materials that fall within the parameters of
potentially exculpatory evidence. It will, however, in the
instant case, whilst reserving its right to take a different
approach in future cases, disclose such materials.6
(ii) The Prosecution submits that a combined reading of Article
67(2) of the Statute and Rule 121(2)(c) provides for disclosure to
the Defence first and for communication to the Pre-Trial
Chamber afterwards only.7
(iii) The Prosecution is of the view that making public materials
considered as falling within the scope of potentially exculpatory
evidence constitutes a decision of the Defence. Accordingly, the
Prosecution will file the respective documents in a confidential
Annex.
5
 The Prosecution will expand its respective observations in the envisaged 6 April 2006 filing.
6
 In a letter dated 31 March 2006, the Prosecution has informed the Duty Counsel for the Defence
accordingly.
7
 Whilst it could be argued that the 30 days deadline as detailed in Rule 121(3) does also apply for the
communication to the Pre-Trial Chamber of evidence disclosed to the Defence, the Prosecution in the
instant case will communicate evidence disclosed to the Defence soon afterwards to the Pre-Trial Chamber.
The Prosecution reserves its right to take a different approach in future cases.

Disclosure of potentially exonerating evidence to the Duty Counsel for the
Defence
4. The Prosecution on Friday, 31 March 2006, has disclosed electronic copies
of six documents containing potentially exonerating evidence to the Duty
Counsel for the Defence.8
Filing of incriminating evidence and potentially exculpatory evidence
5. Being bound by the Decision on the "interim system of disclosure" as
imposed by the Pre-Trial Chamber by its 23 March 2006 and 27 March
2006 Decisions, including in respect of the filing of potentially exculpatory
evidence,9
 the Prosecution herewith files - pending its further observations
on the appropriate system of disclosure and the Court's final decision on
such a system - in the record of the case of The Prosecutor vs. Thomas
LUBANGA DYILO the documents containing potentially exculpatory
evidence that were disclosed to the Duty Counsel for the Defence for
Thomas LUBANGA DYILO on Friday, 31 March 2006.10
8
 The Prosecution, despite its serious concerns in respect of the "interim system of disclosure" as set out by
the Pre-Trial Chamber, due to the importance of timely disclosure, did not want to delay disclosure of
potentially exonerating evidence to the Defence until the time the Court has finally decided on the parties'
observations on the appropriate system of disclosure.
9
 See in particular the 23 March 2006 Decision, at page 5.
10
 The documents are attached as confidential Annexes 1 to 6. The list identifying incriminating evidence
and/or potentially exculpatory evidence is attached as confidential Annex 7. - The Prosecution notes, as can
be seen from the list, that it considers the contents of some documents constituting both evidence of
incriminating and of potentially exculpatory nature. The Prosecution will expand on this aspect and its
impact on the disclosure system as deemed appropriate by the Prosecution in its 6 April 2006 filing.

Inspection of materials pursuant to Rule 77
6. The Prosecution, following the respective request of the Duty Counsel for
the Defence of 23 March 2006, has informed the Duty Counsel for the
Defence by letter of 31 March 2006 inter alia of the following:
"ll]n the meantime, the Pre-Trial Chamber has rendered its 27 March
2006 "Decision Requesting Further Observations from the Prosecution
and the Duty Counsel for the Defence on the System of Disclosure",
making specific reference to your request pursuant to Rule 77. By this
Decision, the Pre-Trial Chamber has imposed an "interim system of
disclosure" that encompasses filing of materials that fall within the
parameters of Rule 77. The Prosecution fundamentally disagrees with
this aspect of the "interim system of disclosure" and will make its
respective observations in its filing envisaged for 6 April 2006. Whilst
the Prosecution does not want to breach a Court order by providing for
inspection of materials that fall within the scope of Rule 77 without
simultaneously submitting such materials to the Court, it is currently for
legal reasons unfortunately not in a position to provide for inspection of
respective materials up until the time the Court has finally decided on the
meaning of "inspection" in terms of Rule 77. Vfe can, however, without
compromising our position, offer - if you agree - to provide you with a first
list detailing a number of documents that fall within the parameters of
Rule 77."

To date, Duty Counsel for the Defence has not yet responded to the
Prosecution's 31 March 2006 letter.
7. As part of its anticipated 6 April 2006 observations on the appropriate
disclosure system, the Prosecution will also expand on these
arguments.
