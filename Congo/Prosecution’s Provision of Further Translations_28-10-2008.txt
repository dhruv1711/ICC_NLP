Trial Chamber that it is now in a position to comply with each of the Trial
Chamber’s pre‐conditions to its review of the Undisclosed Evidence.2  
2. On 22 October 2008, the Prosecution filed the “Prosecution’s submission of 93
documents highlighting the passages of potentially exculpatory value or falling
within the parameters of Rule 77”(22 October Filing).3

Provision of Translations
3. As part of the Application, the Prosecution attached 214 Confidential  ‐ ex parte  ‐
Prosecution only annexes.4  Confidential ‐ ex parte ‐ Prosecution only Annexes 168
to 205 enclosed the 38 full translations of the documents from both the UN and
NGOs that were provided to the Trial Chamber. Confidential  ‐  ex parte  ‐
Prosecution only Annexes 206 to 213 enclosed the 8 partial translations of NGO
documents.  
4. In footnote 28 of the Application, the Prosecution foreshadowed the provision of
a further six translations of UN documents upon completion. Accordingly, these
translations are attached to this filing as Confidential ‐ ex parte ‐ Prosecution only
Annexes 1 to 6. They are translations of UN documents contained in Confidential
‐ ex parte Prosecution only Annexes 10, 11, 31, 33, 34 and 36 of the Application.5  
5. In addition, the Prosecution provides the Trial Chamber with a further translation
of an NGO document contained in Confidential ‐ ex parte Prosecution only Annex
77 of the Application.    This translation is attached as Confidential  ‐  ex parte
Prosecution only Annex 7 to this filing.6  
6. The Prosecution also attaches an updated chart of concordance enabling it to
instantly determine the relation between all of the 93 items and their translations.
This is attached as Public Annex 8.7

4   ICC‐01/04‐01/06‐1477 Conf‐Exp. The Prosecution simultaneously submitted a public redacted
version of its Application with 15 public annexes,  ICC‐01/04‐01/06‐1478.
5   These annexes contain the undredacted versions of the UN documents. The redacted versions of
the same documents are contained in Confidential  ‐ ex parte Prosecution Annexes 147, 136, 131,

Clarifications
Application
7. First, the Prosecution wishes to clarify that in relation to Confidential ‐ ex parte  ‐ 
Prosecution only Annex 127 to the Application8 (which is the redacted version of
the document contained in Confidential  ‐ ex parte  ‐ Prosecution only Annex 6)9
there are highlights (visible in blue in Annex 6) in solid black caused by the
transmission process of the document by the UN to the Prosecution10 which may
appear as redactions; they are not.  The UN has provided another version of this
document without the black highlights, and with the redactions. This document is
attached to the present filing as Confidential – ex parte‐ Prosecution only Annex 9.
8. Second, in relation to Confidential ‐ ex parte ‐ Prosecution only Annexes 152 and
153 to the Application, the Prosecution informs the Trial Chamber that redactions
applied to the content of these documents were no longer necessary as the same
information is already publicly available and therefore the 2 correct documents
are resubmitted as Confidential – ex parte‐ Prosecution only Annexes 10 and 11.   

exculpatory value or falling within the parameters of Rule 77, with Confidential ‐  ex parte  ‐ 
Prosecution only Annexes 1 to 94 and public Annex 95”, ICC‐01/04‐01/06‐1488.

9   DRC‐OTP‐0003‐0339, also provided as Annex 1 to the “Prosecution’s submission of 93 documents
highlighting the passages of potentially exculpatory value or falling within the parameters of Rule
77”.
10   As indicated on the document in Confidential  ‐  ex parte Prosecution only Annex 127 to the
Application.

entire document was determined to fall within Rule 77 parameters.
