Background
1. By Decisions of 23 and 27 March 2006, ' the Pre-Trial Chamber imposed on
the Parties an interim system of disclosure (Pre-Trial Chamber's
system). The Prosecution on 3 April 20062
 made its first comments on the
Pre-Trial Chamber's system, followed by extended observations on 6
April 2006.3
 The same day, Defence commented on the Pre-Trial
Chamber's system.4
2. On 7 April 2006, the Pre-Trial Chamber issued a Decision5
 scheduling a
hearing on disclosure for Monday, 24 April 2006, indicating that the
Parties would be provided with an agenda ( a set of specific questions )
for the hearing by Friday, 21 April 2006 .
6
 Following a Joint Request
of the Parties7
 to provide the agenda for the hearing in sufficient time,
namely at least three working days prior to the hearing,8
 the Pre-Trial
Chamber on 19 April 20069
 issued its Decision, detailing the set of
specific questions - comprised of about 50 agenda items and sub-items -
for the 24 April 2006 hearing.

3. On 24 April 2006, the hearing took place in public session. Both Parties
made first general observations in respect of the Pre-Trial Chamber's
system and then addressed, to the extent the Single Judge wanted the
Parties to address them, the agenda items in detail.
4. Following a request of the Prosecution10
 and the Defence,11
 the Single
Judge of the Pre-Trial Chamber set both Parties a deadline for 2 May 2006
to submit their final observations on the system of disclosure.12
The Pre-Trial Chamber's system
5. The Prosecution refers to both its observations made in the context of its
filings as detailed above and its submissions in the course of the 24 April
2006 hearing.13
 In the instant submission, to avoid repetitive submissions,
the Prosecution summarises and highlights its main concerns in respect of
the Pre-Trial Chamber's system. The Prosecution's concerns are grounded
in both the applicable law and the practical difficulties the Prosecution has
already encountered and further anticipates in implementing the Pre-Trial
Chamber's system.
10
 The request was made in light of the short period of time the Pre-Trial Chamber had granted to the
Parties to prepare for the 24 April 2006 hearing, see transcript of the 24 April 2006 hearing, at page 8.

 The Prosecution includes its earlier observations and all references made in respect of applicable
jurisprudence by way of reference in the present filing. The Prosecution has noted the observations of the
Single Judge in respect of paragraph 8 of the Prosecution's 6 April 2006 Submission during the 24 April
2006 hearing (see transcript, at page 46). The Prosecution reiterates its observations in footnote 14 of the 6
April 2006 Submission.

6. The Prosecution specifically notes that the Parties share serious concerns
in relation to key elements of the Pre-Trial Chamber's system.14
 The
Parries' common concerns relate to the core of the pre-confirmation
hearing disclosure, including (i) the disclosure of the incriminatory
evidence on which the Prosecution intends to rely on for the purposes of
the confirmation hearing pursuant to Article 61(3)(b) (incriminatory
evidence) of the Rome Statute (Statute) and (ii) the disclosure of
potentially exculpatory evidence within the parameters of Article 67(2) of
the Statute.
Pre-Trial Chamber's system is not supported by the applicable law, it is extrastatutory
7. The Pre-Trial Chamber's system, as established by the 23 March 2006
Decision, requests the Prosecution to disclose both incriminatory evidence
and potentially exculpatory evidence to the Defence by way of filing such
evidence in the record of the case of The Prosecutor vs. Thomas LUBANGA
DYILO, and the Registry, following the Prosecution's filing, to provide
access as soon as practicable
 15
 to the Defence. By its 27 March 2006
Decision, the Pre-Trial Chamber16
 extended the interim system of

'" "Considering that the consistency of the process of disclosure of any type of evidence or material,
which, for the purpose of the confirmation hearing, must be disclosed pursuant to articles 61 (3) and 67 (2)
of the Statute and rules 76 to 79 and 121 of the Rules, is fundamental to ensure the preservation of
evidence, effectiveness of the disclosure process, protection of victims and witnesses and proper
safeguarding of the rights of Mr Thomas Lubanga Dyilo: (emphasis in Italics by the Prosecution), see page
4 of the 27 march 2006 Decision.

disclosure via Registry, to also cover all evidence or materials submitted
by the prosecution pursuant to rule 77 of the Rules ,
17
8. The Prosecution submits that the Pre-Trial Chamber's system violates two
fundamental principles of law as set out in the Statute and the Rules of
Procedure and Evidence (Rules), namely
(i) the principle that disclosure is directly between the Prosecution
and the Defence and vice versa, without the Registry or any
other third party being the intermediary; and
(ii) the principle that there is a fundamental difference between
disclosure of incriminatory evidence and potentially
exculpatory evidence pursuant to Articles 61(3)(b) and 67(2) of
the Statute and the provision of access to inspect materials that
fall within the scope of Rules 77 and 78 of the Rules.
9. The Pre-Trial Chamber's system neglects the principle that disclosure is
directly between the Prosecution and the Defence and vice versa, without
the Registry (or any other third party) acting as the intermediary:
(i) The applicable law states that disclosure is between the Parties,
and the Parties only: In respect of incriminatory evidence, this
view is reflected in Rule 121(2)(c), which states that evidence
17
 See pages 4 to 6 ofthe 27 March 2006 Decision, in particular at page 6.
No. : ICC:-01/04-01/06 5 2 May 2006
ICC-01/04-01/06-91 02-05-2006 5/13 SL PT
disclosed between the Prosecutor and the person shall be
communicated to the Pre-Trial Chamber . The language used
in Rule 121(2)(c) allows for the sole interpretation that
disclosure takes place between the Parties.18
 In respect of
potentially exculpatory evidence, this system is reinforced, and
becomes even clearer, by Article 67(2) stating that the
Prosecutor shall, ..., disclose to the defence .... The very same
system applies in the context of Rules 77 and 78: Rule 77 states
that [t]he Prosecutor shall,..., permit the defence to inspect... ,
and Rule 78 regulates that [t]he defence shall permit the
Prosecutor to inspect . None of the applicable provisions
indicate that in the process of disclosure and/or inspection the
Registry is supposed to play a role.
(ii) The Prosecution's submission is confirmed by Rule 121(10).
Rule 121(10) is the only Rule that provides for a role for the
Registry in the disclosure process. It defines and limits the
Registry's function to the passive role of including in the
Court's record all documents transmitted to the Pre-Trial
Chamber pursuant to Rule 121. Rule 121(10) does not go
beyond that function, and in particular does not assign the
Registry any active role in the context of the disclosure process
between the Parries. Due to its clear language, Rule 121(10)
does not provide for an interpretation expanding the limits of
the Registry's role as defined in it. In no circumstance does Rule
121(10) provide that the Registry is assigned the role of an

 The Prosecution draws particular attention to the French version of Rule 121(2)(c), which lends further
support to the Prosecution's view.

ICC-01/04-01/06-91 02-05-2006 6/13 SL PT
intermediary in the disclosure process between the Parties as
currently regulated in the Pre-Trial Chamber's system.
(iii) The Prosecution stresses that disclosure, and in particular that
of potentially exculpatory material, is a specific duty of the
Prosecution, which has been rightly characterized as being as
important as the obligation to prosecute itself.
 19
 It is submitted
that the Prosecution should not be requested to accept a system
which would effectively imply a dereliction of its statutory
duties of disclosure, in the same manner that it should not be
requested to accept any system entailing a delegation of critical
investigative or prosecutorial tasks to a different organ of the
Court.
(iv) The Prosecution submits that only a disclosure system of direct
disclosure between the Parties maintains the clear allocation of
responsibilities and accountability. The disclosure process
entails a number of serious responsibilities for the Parties
involved in it. The law, by providing for direct disclosure
between the Parties, has deliberately and for good reasons
assigned these responsibilities - and the related accountability -
to the Parties. The Pre-Trial Chamber's system, by establishing

Evidence
 20
 destroys that system of clear responsibilities and
accountability. Disclosure of both incriminatory evidence and
potentially exculpatory evidence is highly sensitive by the very
nature of the contents of the disclosed evidentiary materials.
Due to the complexities of the disclosure process, it is subject to
mistakes and oversights that have the potential, inter alia, to
impact on the safety and security of victims and witnesses. By
adding the Registry as an intermediary to the disclosure
process, the Pre-Trial Chamber's system consequently increases
the possibility that mistakes will in fact occur,21
 and it
significantly increases the possibility that such mistakes cannot
be attributed to either the Prosecution, the Defence or the
Registry. The Prosecution prefers to be held accountable for its
own mistakes rather than for mistakes of others, and tries to
avoid arguing about in which area of responsibility - the
Prosecution's, the Defence's or the Registry's - a mistake has
occurred.
(v) Finally, in the context of disclosure, both the Prosecution and
the Defence are subject to deadlines governing the disclosure
~" See 23 March 2006 Decision, at page 7.
:
' The Prosecution wishes to again emphasize, as it has done at the occasion of the 24 April 2006 hearing,
that it has no doubts in respect of the high competence of the Registry's staff. The Prosecution in its
submission describes the objective possibilities of mistakes and oversights, dt'spite highly competent staff
being involved in the process.

process.22
 If disclosure is delegated to the Registry to provide
access as soon as practicable ,
23
 the Party who is bound by the
deadlines is no longer effectively in control of such deadlines.
10. The Pre-Trial Chamber's system, in emphasizing the consistency of the
process of disclosure of any type of evidence or materials,
 24
 neglects the
fundamental difference between disclosure of incriminatory and
potentially exculpatory evidence pursuant to Articles 61(3)(b) and 67(2) of
the Statute and the provision of access to materials for inspection that fall
within the scope of Rules 77 and 78.25
(i) Article 61(3)(b) - read together with Rule 121(2) - and Article
67(2) provide for disclosure in the sense of handing over by the
Prosecution to the Defence (copies of) evidentiary materials.
Rules 77 and 78, in contrast, provide for inspection of tangible
objects only. In the Prosecution's submission, the notion of
inspection means that the Prosecution, on its premises,
provides the Defence access to the materials as detailed in Rule
77 (and, in respect of Rule 78, vice versa).
(ii) Whilst the Prosecution agrees that Rules 77 and 78 fall under the
broad notion of disclosure ,
2e>
 the very existence of Rules 77
and 78 support the distinction made by the Prosecution. If there
::
 See Articles 61(3), 67(2) and Rules 76, 77, 78, 79, 83. 121.
"' See 23 March 2006 Decision, at page 7.
24
 See 27 March 2006 Decision, at page 4. Footnote 7 details the full quote.
23
 As made already clear in prior filings by the Prosecution, this difference of regime is firmly established
by the same international criminal practice that provided the direct source of the relevant ICC provisions.
:
" As can be seen from the title of Section II of Chapter IV of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence.
No. : ICC-01/04-01/06 9 2 May 2006
ICC-01/04-01/06-91 02-05-2006 9/13 SL PT
were no difference between disclosure in the sense of handing
over (copies of) evidentiary materials and inspection of
tangible objects, these provisions would be redundant.
(iii) This view is supported by the different purposes of disclosure
pursuant to Article 61(3)(b) and Article 67(2) and inspection
in terms of Rules 77 and 78. Whereas in respect of materials
disclosed under Articles 61(3)(b) and 67(2) the evidentiary value
lies in the content of such materials (as, primarily, documents
and witness statements), Rules 77 and 78 refer to tangible
objects , thus physical evidence, in allowing the respective
other Party to examine the physical integrity of materials.
11. The Prosecution notes that The Pre-Trial Chamber's system comes close to
creating a "dossier" system via disclosure. The Prosecution submits that a
"dossier" system is not supported by the applicable law.27
 Accordingly, in
the event that the Pre-Trial Chamber's system becomes the final system of
disclosure, the Prosecution envisages serious consequences in respect of
both the scope and the selection of information it would disclose to the
Pre-Trial Chamber.
:7
 Commentators agree that the Prosecutor "has no general disclosure obligation insofar as the Prosecutor
is not obliged to disclose in advance of the confirmation hearing all of the inculpatory evidence in his or her
possession, but rather only the evidence on which he or she intends to rely at the hearing (Art. 61(5)).
These commentaries emphasize that the Prosecutor retains discretion in the presentation and disclosure of
evidence at this stage and. accordingly, that the legal and procedural framework applicable to the Court
does not reflect a "dossier system. See Helen Brady, "Disclosure of Evidence , Ch. 5, The International
Criminal Court, Elements of Crimes and Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Ed. Roy S. Lee (2001,
Transnational Publishers. Inc.). p. 407 and The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court: A

Tlie Pre-Trial Chamber's system hampers effective disclosure
12. The Pre-Trial Chamber's system seriously hampers effective disclosure. It
thus contradicts the purpose of disclosure in preparation of the
confirmation hearing:
(i) The experience of the Parties to date, in an effort to comply with
the Pre-Trial Chamber's system, shows that the Registry is not
in a position to provide for effective disclosure: In order to
allow for disclosure at the earliest possible opportunity, the
Prosecution, despite its fundamental disagreement in relation to
the Registry being the intermediary in the disclosure process,
has complied with the interim system of disclosure : On two
occasions - after having disclosed the very same materials to the
Defence - the Prosecution filed disclosure materials. On 3 April
2006, the Prosecution filed the first set of disclosure materials,
comprised of six documents only. Counsel for the Defence was
notified on 6 April 2006. Accordingly, it took the Registry more
than three working days to disclose six documents. On Friday,
21 April 2006, the Prosecution filed the second set of disclosure
materials, this time comprised of 24 documents. Counsel for the
Defence was notified on Monday, 1 May 2006. Accordingly, it
took the Registry almost six working days to disclose these

ICC-01/04-01/06-91 02-05-2006 11/13 SL PT
documents to Counsel for the Defence.28
 In fact, between
disclosure by the Prosecution of the very same materials
directly to the Defence and disclosure via the Registry as the
intermediary, more than ten calendar days had passed.
(ii) The Prosecution submits that the experience to date
demonstrating the practical difficulties and impediments of the
Pre-Trial Chamber's system gives a clear indication that the
Registry in future will not be in a position to provide for
effective disclosure. This will in particular be the case when the
Parties disclose sets of materials that will be comprised of
significantly more materials and which, in light of Article
61(3)(b) and Rule 121(3), will involve tight deadlines.
13. To summarise, the Prosecution submits that (i) the Pre-Trial Chamber's
system in its key components is not supported by the applicable law, it is
thus extra-statutory, and (ii) the difficulties of implementing it into
practice defeats the purposes of effective disclosure.
28
 The Prosecution notes the significant discrepancy between the statements made by the Registry in the
context of the 24 April 2006 hearing and the current realities, '['he Prosecution refers, in particular, to the
transcript of the 24 April 2006 hearing, at page 44, lines 9 to 12; at page 77, at lines 23 to 25; and at page
78, at lines 15 to 21. The Prosecution notes, in this context, that its disclosure obligations are now
governed by tight deadlines. The Prosecution, therefore, at this stage, cannot rely on assurances that, at an
uncertain point in time in the future, the Registry may be in a position to provide for the technical means to
discharge its duties under the Pre-Trial Chamber's system. The Prosecution wishes to emphasize again that
it has full confidence in the Registry's staff and makes this observation for the sole reason of showing the
practical difficulties that the Pre-Trial Chamber's system causes for all parties and organs of the Court
involved in it.

Request
14. The Prosecution requests the Pre-Trial Chamber29
 to abandon its interim
system of disclosure and to instead adopt a disclosure system that, in
compliance with the law and thus ensuring effective disclosure, meets the
following criteria:
(i) Direct disclosure between the Parties, without the Registry or
any other third party being the intermediary;
(ii) Clear distinction between disclosure of incriminatory and
potentially exculpatory evidence by handing over (copies of)
such materials and inspection of materials that fall within the
scope of Rules 77 and 78 by providing access to such materials;
(iii) Communication of disclosed materials to the Pre-Trial Chamber
within the boundaries of Rule 12l(2)(c),x
 and refraining from
creating a "dossier" system via disclosure.

Dated this 2nd

At The Hague, The Netherlands
211
 The Prosecution in the past has made, in cooperation with Counsel for the Defence, substantial efforts in
order to discharge its respective disclosure obligations within the deadlines as foreseen in the applicable
law. The Prosecution refers to its detailed oral submissions in the course of the 24 April 2006 hearing (see
at page 13, lines 17 to 25, and at page 14, lines 1 to 12). At this stage, in view of the Prosecution, both
Parties would benefit from a final decision being rendered by the Pre-Trial Chamber within a time-frame
that allows the Prosecution - and possibly the Defence - to take the possible necessary steps at a time that
coincides with the legal deadlines.
'° The Prosecution may. in the one or the other instance, within its discretion, communicate additional
evidentiary materials to the Pre-Trial Chamber.
