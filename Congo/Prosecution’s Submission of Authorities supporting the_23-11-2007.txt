Introduction
1. In the present filing the Prosecution, pursuant to the authorisation of the Trial
Chamber, submits a number of authorities which support the possibility
discussed during the status conference on 20 November 2007, to withdraw
specific elements of the charges added by the Pre-Trial Chamber.
Procedural Background
2. Pursuant to orders of the Trial Chamber,1
 the Prosecution filed submissions
relating to, inter alia, the status of decisions of the Pre-Trial Chamber on 12
September 2007.2
 The Defence3
 and the Legal Representatives of Victims4
 filed
submissions on 16 November 2007.
3. On 20 November 2007, the Trial Chamber held a status conference, to discuss
these issues.5
4. At this hearing, the Prosecution stated it was ready to lead all relevant evidence
in its possession relating to the armed conflict, including both potentially
internationalized and non-international aspects of the conflict in order to provide
clarity at the outset that the Prosecution's case contains both possibilities. The
Prosecution further submitted that if, after the presentation of the evidence, the
Trial Chamber were to conclude that the evidence presented might also establish
the crime included in Article 8(2)(e)(vii), then the Chamber could apply this
provision, resorting to Regulation 55 if necessary.6
 Alternatively, it was submitted
that the Chamber could provide early notice to participants under Regulation 55,
in order again to ensure that all participants are on full notice from an early stage

of the potential recharacterisation of the charges (from Article 8(2)(b)(xxvi) to
8(2)(e)(vii)).
 7 Finally, the Prosecution also submitted that should the Chamber
consider the proprio motu amendment of the charges to be null and void, the
Chamber could disregard that confined part of the Confirmation Decision while
maintaining its valid portions.8
5. In addition, during the status conference the Presiding Judge raised the
possibility to withdraw the charge or the charges, pursuant to Article 61(9).9
 In
connection with this possibility, the issue of partial withdrawal of the charges was
raised during the hearing.10
 The Chamber enquired whether there was material
supporting such a partial withdrawal of charges, and granted the Prosecution
leave to file any such material by 4.00pm on 23 November 2007.11
6. The Prosecution hereby files material from the ICTY supporting the possibility of
withdrawing part of a charge. The Prosecution understands "partial withdrawal
of charges" to mean the withdrawal of specific factual allegations or elements
from the charges, which may result in a change of the legal characterisation,
without withdrawing the whole charge or a particular count.
Authorities
7. A brief survey of the ICTY jurisprudence demonstrates that the possibility of
partial withdrawal of charges is broadly accepted, despite the fact that the
relevant provision of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the ICTY makes
reference only to "the indictment".12
 The partial withdrawal of charges by the

9
 See e.g. ICC-01/04-01/06-T-61-ENG, p. 36[15]ff. The Prosecution had foreshadowed that other remedies
might be available, including the possibility of applying to withdraw an element of the charges pursuant to
Article 61(9), and had expressed its willingness to explore such further possibilities and assist the Chamber with
supplementary submissions (if necessary) in its original filing (ICC-01/04-01/06-953, footnote 43).

Prosecution has been linked to the Prosecution's right to prepare and present its
case in the manner that it considers to be the most adequate.13
8. In the very first case tried before the ICTY, the trial against Dusko Tndic, the
prosecution charged the accused with 34 counts.14
 Count 1 (persecution) was
based on a wide array of crimes committed during different periods of time.15
Among other things, the prosecution alleged that:
"[d]uring the period between September 1992 and December 1992, in Trnopolje
camp or in the adjacent area, TADIC physically took part or otherwise participated
in the killing of more than 30 detainees, including groups of male detainees
executed near a white house adjacent to the camp and a group of male detainees
executed in a plum orchard adjacent to the camp. TADIC also physically took part
or otherwise participated in the torture of more than 12 female detainees, including
several gang rapes, which occurred both in the camp and at a white house adjacent
to the camp".16
These allegations were supported only by the testimony of one witness. During
trial, aspects of the testimony of that witness were revealed which led the
Prosecution to state in open court that it did not consider him a witness of truth
and to submit a motion to withdraw these allegations.17
 In the Trial Judgement,
the Trial Chamber found that these allegations were therefore no longer part of
the charges against the accused.18
 The Trial Chamber nevertheless convicted the
accused on count 1 of the crime of persecution basing its conviction on the
remaining factual allegations included in paragraph 4 of the indictment.19
13
 In the case against Mile Mrskic, the accused argued after the joinder of his case and filing of a consolidated
indictment that the Prosecution must provide further explanation, "in particular the withdrawal of allegations that
appeared in the Second Amended Indictment." In denying the request for explanation, the Trial Chamber held
that "The Prosecution is free to plead its case as it sees fit, as long as it sets out the material facts that will allow
the Defence to meet the case." - Prosecutor v Mrskic et al, IT-95-13/1-PT, Decision on Form of Consolidated
Amended Indictment and on Prosecution Application to Amend, 23 January 2004, para. 14:

9. In the case against Enver Hadzihasanovic et al, the initial indictment pleaded that
"At all times relevant to this indictment, a state of international armed conflict
and partial occupation existed in Bosnia and Herzegovina".20
 The Prosecution
was, inter alia, "ordered to amend the indictment to clearly state between which
states it is alleging an international armed conflict existed".21
 However the
amended indictment did not clarify matters as ordered; rather, the Prosecution
merely pleaded that "At all times relevant to this indictment, an armed conflict
existed on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina."22
 Thus the Prosecution,
without seeking the permission of the Chamber, withdrew the allegation that the
armed conflict had been international in character. The underlying conduct
relating to the crimes pleaded remained the same; however, because the
allegation that the conflict was international had been withdrawn, the legal
characterisation of the crimes was also changed.23
 Both the Appeals Chamber24
and the Defence25
 characterised the actions of the Prosecution as a withdrawal of
the allegations that the armed conflict was international.

clarify or strike out its allegations relating to the partial occupation (paras. 30-38) and to make other amendments
relating to the pleading of command responsibility, alleged imprecision in the indictment, and reorganising the
structure of the indictment.

Amended Indictment, 26 September 2003, para. 8: http://www.un.org/ictv/indictment/english/had3ai030926e.htm
23
 The number of counts also changed, as the change in characterization of the armed conflict meant that counts
based on the grave breaches provision were no longer an option. The underlying conduct pleaded remained the
same, however, with the exception that some conduct was pleaded with slightly more specificity, and one set of
counts (hostages and unlawful labour), fell away entirely.

 Prosecutor v Hadzihasanovic et al, IT-01-47-T, Decision on Defence motion regarding cross-examination of
witnesses by the Prosecution, 9 December 2004 ("NOTING that, in support of its request, the Defence submits
... v) that, at its own initiative, the Prosecution withdrew the allegation of an international armed conflict
mentioned in the initial Indictment of 5 July 2001"): http://www.un.org/ictv/hadzihas/trialc/decisione/041209.htm. The Trial Chamber appeared to accept this characterisation as a withdrawal of specific
allegations.

10. Furthermore, in this same case against Enver Hadzihasanovic et al, the Prosecution
withdrew the allegations relating to the commission of wanton destruction crimes
(counts 5 and 6) at one particular crime-site (Dusina).26
 The withdrawal was
made in the Prosecution's Pre-Trial Brief,27
 did not amend the indictment,28
 and
does not appear to have been challenged by the Chamber.
11. In the case against Radoslav Brdanin, the accused was charged with 12 counts for
crimes pertaining to 16 municipalities. The Prosecution later withdrew the
charges in respect of Bihac-Ripac, Bosanska Dubica and Bosanska Gradiska
municipalities, but maintained all 12 counts of the indictment.29
 The Trial
Chamber took notice of the above and found that there is no case to answer in
relation to the incidents charged to have occurred in these municipalities. The
Trial Chamber ruled that the incidents in question are being struck from the
indictment.30
 Accordingly, the amended indictment filed by the Prosecution,
while containing the same 12 counts, it does not include any allegations with
respect to crimes committed in the municipalities of Bihac-Ripac, Bosanska
Dubica and Bosanska Gradiska.31
 The amendment affected the factual basis of all
12 counts of the indictment.32

12. During the trial against Mitar Vasiljevic, the Prosecution led evidence on a
particular killing incident to establish the widespread and systematic attack
against the civilian population of Visegrad and the accused's link with a
particular paramilitary group. The accused was not charged with that specific
killing incident. The only witness to testify about this incident was Witness VG115, who described the killing incident and identified the accused as one of the
perpetrators. During cross examination, the witness refused to reveal the name of
the person who was witnessing the incident together with her. As a consequence,
the Prosecution agreed to "withdraw any reference of this incident". The Trial
Chamber accordingly ruled to "exclude this incident from [its] consideration".33
13. In the trial against Naser Oric, the indictment charged the accused with four
counts of wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages not justified by military
necessity, and plunder of public or private property.34
 The crime base for these
counts included, among other things, the alleged attack by the TO on the village
of Rupovo Brod on 10 June 1992.35
 Shortly before the commencement of the trial,
the prosecution submitted a motion to the Trial Chamber seeking leave to
withdraw the allegations in relation to the attack on this village.36
 The Trial
Chamber granted the motion orally and instructed the prosecution to "remove
[....] all factual allegations pertaining to the village of Rupovo Brod and thus
remove paragraph 30 and strike off reference to Rupovo Brod from paragraph 36
of the indictment".37

conflict".

complied with the instructions of the Trial Chamber. Counts 3-6 of the indictment
remained otherwise unaltered.38
14. In the Krnojelac case, the indictment charged the accused with, among other
crimes, three counts of enslavement.39
 Under these counts, the Prosecution
alleged that detainees were required to perform various tasks in the KP Dom
prison kitchen, as well as in other areas such as the furniture factory and the
metal and mechanical workshop.40
 However, the Prosecution's Final Trial Brief
indicated that allegations as to being required to work in the kitchen were not
charged as enslavement,41
 leading the Trial Chamber to "regar[d] this indication
as a withdrawal of those charges."42
 The Trial Chamber nevertheless considered
the remaining factual allegations in the same paragraph in reaching a finding on
the counts of enslavement.43
15. In the case against Milomir Stakic, the accused was charged with five counts of
genocide, complicity in genocide, murder, and extermination; one count of
persecution and two counts of deportation and inhumane acts.44
 During the trial,
the Presiding Judge expressly requested that the Prosecution consider
withdrawing certain factual allegations relating to charges.45
 As the Prosecution's
case at trial drew to a close, the Prosecution filed a document conceding that there
was insufficient evidence as to four allegations contained in the Fourth Amended

Prosecution, as described above. Count 17 of the indictment was withdrawn independently from the above
withdrawal of facts, as a consequence of a general withdrawal by the Prosecution of all counts which were
charged as grave breaches (Ibid, para. 541, last sentence).

 and therefore requesting permission to withdraw these specific
allegations.47
 The Trial Chamber granted permission orally during a discussion
between the Chamber and the parties in open court prior to the close of the
Prosecution case,48
 and the Fourth Amended Indictment, with the same counts,
remained in effect.49
Conclusion
16. The Prosecution submits that these authorities demonstrate that Trial Chambers
in the ICTY have permitted the Prosecution to withdraw certain elements within
a charge without withdrawing the entirety of that charge, including withdrawing
the characterisation of the relevant armed conflict as international. Without
prejudice to the other avenues presented by the Prosecution, as recalled in
paragraphs 2-6 above, the Prosecution requests that the Trial Chamber consider
these authorities within the context of the options before it in its determination of
the status of the Pre-Trial Chamber's amendment of the charges in the
Confirmation Decision.
