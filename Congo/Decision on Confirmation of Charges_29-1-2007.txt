I. INTRODUCTION
A. Factual Background
1. The District of Ituri before 1 July 2002
1. Ituri is a district in the Orientale Province of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (the DRC). It is bordered by Uganda to the east and Sudan to the north. Its
population is between 3.5 and 5.5 million people, of whom only about 100,000 live in
Bunia, the district capital. Ituri’s population consists of some 20 different ethnic
groups, the largest being the Hemas, the Alurs, the Biras, the Lendus and their
southern sub-group, the Ngitis.
2. Ituri is rich in natural resources, such as gold, oil, timber, coltan and
diamonds. For example, the Mongwalu mine, which is located about forty-five
kilometres north-west of Bunia, is the most important gold mine in the DRC and one
of the most important in Central Africa.
3. The majority of the population of Ituri makes its living from agriculture, and
the rest from trade, animal husbandry and fishing. Agriculture is the principal
economic activity of the Lendus, while the Hemas are more active in livestock
farming.
4. In the summer of 1999, tensions developed as a result of disputes over the
allocation of land in Ituri and the appropriation of natural resources. During the
second half of 2002, there was renewed violence in various parts of the district.
2. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo
5. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was born in 1960 in Jiba (Djugu territory of Ituri,
Orientale Province, DRC), and belongs to the Hema ethnic group. He studied at the
University of Kisangani, where he obtained a degree in psychology. From 1986 to
1997, he allegedly headed an organisation called “Votura”. From 1990 to 1994, he was
also allegedly assistant at the CEPROMAD University. Throughout that period, he

No. 01/04-01/06 6/157 29 January 2007
Official Court Translation
also engaged in other income-generating activities, ranging from farming to gold
trading.
6. On the evidence presented for the purpose of the confirmation hearing, it
would appear that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo entered politics between late 1999 and
early 2000. Soon thereafter, he was elected to the Ituri District Assembly.
1
7. On 15 September 2000, the statutes of the Union des Patriots Congolais (UPC)
were signed by Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, as the first signatory, and several other
persons who subsequently held leadership positions within the party and its armed
military wing, the Forces Patriotiques pour la Libération du Congo (FPLC). In August
2002, the UPC took control of Bunia.2
8. In early September 2002, the UPC was renamed Union des Patriotes
Congolais/Réconciliation et Paix (UPC/RP) and Thomas Lubanga Dyilo appointed its
President. A few days later, in Bunia, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo signed the decree
appointing the members of the first UPC/RP executive for the Ituri District. At the
same time, a second decree officially established the FPLC. Immediately after the
establishment of the FPLC, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo became its Commander-in-Chief.
3. Prosecution allegations against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo
9. In the “Document Containing the Charges, Article 61(3)(a),”
3
filed on 28
August 2006, the Prosecution charges Thomas Lubanga Dyilo under articles
8(2)(e)(vii) and 25(3)(a) of the Statute with the war crimes of conscripting and
enlisting children under the age of fifteen years into an armed group (in this case, the
FPLC, military wing of the UPC since September 2002)4 and using them to participate

actively in hostilities.5 The Prosecution submits that “the crimes occurred in the
context of an armed conflict not of an international character.”
6
10. The Prosecution asserts that even prior to the founding of the FPLC, the UPC
actively recruited children under the age of fifteen years in significant numbers and
subjected them to military training in its military training camp in Sota, amongst
other places.7
11. The Prosecution further submits that, after its founding and until the end of
2003, the FPLC continued to systematically enlist and conscript children under the
age of fifteen years in large numbers in order to provide them with military training,
and use them subsequently to participate actively in hostilities,8
including as
bodyguards for senior FPLC military commanders.9 The FPLC military training
camps included camps in Centrale, Mandro, Rwampara, Irumu and Bule.10
12. The Prosecution submits that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo is criminally responsible
for the crimes listed in the Document Containing the Charges as a co-perpetrator,
jointly with other FPLC officers and UPC members and supporters.11
B. Major procedural steps
13. On 5 July 2004, the Presidency of the Court assigned the Situation in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo to the Chamber.12
14. On 16 September 2004, Judge Claude Jorda was declared Presiding Judge of
the Chamber.13

15. On 12 January 2006, the Prosecution filed the application requesting the
issuance of a warrant of arrest against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo.14
16. On 10 February 2006, the Chamber issued a warrant of arrest against Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo.15 A request for his arrest and surrender was then transmitted to the
Democratic Republic of the Congo on 24 February 2006.16 On 16 and 17 March,
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was arrested in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
surrendered to the Court and transferred to the Court’s detention centre in The
Hague.
17. On 20 March 2006, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo made his first appearance before
the Chamber at a hearing during which the Chamber satisfied itself that he had been
informed of the crimes which he is alleged to have committed and of his rights. At
that hearing, the Chamber announced that the confirmation hearing would be held
on 27 June 2006.
18. On 22 March 2006, the Chamber designated Judge Sylvia Steiner as Single
Judge responsible for exercising the functions of the Chamber in the instant case,
including those functions provided for in rule 121(2)(b) of the Rules of Procedure and
Evidence (“the Rules”).17 On 15 and 19 May 2006, the Single Judge rendered two
decisions on the system of disclosure and the establishment of a timetable.18
19. On 28 July and 20 October 2006, the Chamber granted the status of victims
authorised to participate in the case of The Prosecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo to
Applicants a/0001/06, a/0002/06, a/0003/06 and a/0105/06.

existence of a direct causal link between the harm suffered by the applicant and the
charges brought against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo.
20. In the Document Containing the Charges, filed on 28 August 2006, the
Prosecution submits that between 1 July 2002 and 31 December 2003, Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo, as a co-perpetrator, conscripted and enlisted children under the age
of fifteen years and used them to participate actively in hostilities.20
21. On 22 September 2006, the Chamber rendered a decision on the arrangements
for the participation of victims at the confirmation hearing.21
22. On 3 October 2006, the Chamber rejected the challenge to the Court’s
jurisdiction made by the Defence under article 19(2)(a) of the Statute.22 In a decision
rendered on 14 December 2006, the Appeals Chamber upheld the impugned
decision.23
23. On 2 August,24 15 and 20 September25 and 4 October 2006,26 the Chamber

the end of the confirmation hearing.
25. On 18 October 2006, Single Judge Claude Jorda rejected the application for
interim release submitted by the Defence for Thomas Lubanga Dyilo.27

26. On 19 and 20 October 2006, the Chamber rendered two decisions authorising
the Prosecutor to call a staff member of the United Nations Organization to testify
before the Chamber at the confirmation hearing. It also authorised an observer from
the United Nations to attend the hearing.
27. On 20 October 2006 also, the Prosecution addressed its final List of Evidence to
the Chamber under rule 121(3) of the Rules.28 On 2 and 7 November 2006, the
Defence filed its List of Evidence.
29
28. At the hearing of 26 October 2006, the Prosecution informed the Chamber of
its intention to proof the witness whom it intended to call to testify at the
confirmation hearing.
29. On 8 November 2006, the Chamber rendered a decision on the proofing of
witnesses before they testify before the Court30 in which it ordered the Victims and
Witnesses Unit to familiarise the witness with the Court, to explain to her how
proceedings are conducted before the Court, with particular reference to the
confirmation hearing, and to discuss with the witness matters relating to her
protection. The Chamber also ordered the Prosecution not to proof the witness and to
refrain from all contact with her outside the courtroom from the moment she made
the solemn undertaking provided for in rule 66 of the Rules.
30. The confirmation hearing in this case was held from 9 to 28 November 2006 in
accordance with the terms set on 7 November 2006 pursuant to rule 122(1) of the
Rules.31
31. Following the hearing, on 1 and 4 December 2006, the Representatives of the
Victims filed written observations on points of fact and law discussed at the

hearing.32 The Prosecution’s observations addressing matters that were discussed at
the confirmation hearing were filed on 4 December 2006.33 On 6 December 2006, the
Defence filed its brief on points of fact and law discussed at the hearing.34
32. On 14 December 2006, the Appeals Chamber reversed35 the decisions of 15 and
20 September 2006 on the redactions made by the Prosecution under rule 81 of the
Rules.36 The Appeals Chamber held that the Pre-Trial Chamber’s decision lacked
sufficient reasoning authorising the redactions for the purpose of protecting further
investigations under rule 81(2) of the Rules or to protect the identity of victims,
where necessary, under rule 81(4) of the Rules. The Appeals Chamber held that this
error materially affected the Impugned Decision in that it could not be established,
on the basis of the reasoning that was provided, how the Pre-Trial Chamber had
arrived at its decision.37

II. PRELIMINARY EVIDENTIARY MATTERS
A. The standard under article 61(7) of the Statute
33. Pursuant to article 61(7) of the Statute:
The Pre-Trial Chamber shall, on the basis of the hearing, determine whether there
is sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that the person
committed each of the crimes charged. Based on its determination, the Pre-Trial
Chamber shall:
a) Confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that there is
sufficient evidence, and commit the person to a Trial Chamber for trial on the
charges as confirmed;
b) Decline to confirm those charges in relation to which it has determined that
there is insufficient evidence;
c) Adjourn the hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider:
i) Providing further evidence or conducting further investigation with
respect to a particular charge; or
ii) Amending a charge because the evidence submitted appears to establish a
different crime within the jurisdiction of the Court.
34. The Prosecution considers that in construing the “substantial grounds to
believe” standard under article 61(7) of the Statute, the object and purpose of the
confirmation hearing must be taken into account. It submits that the purpose of the
confirmation hearing is to ensure that the evidence is sufficient to justify committal
for trial, adding that the presentation of summaries as provided for in article 61(5) of
the Statute supports this viewpoint. The Prosecution goes on to say that the standard
prescribed by article 61(7) comes close to the standard defined as “...a credible case
which would (if not contradicted by the Defence) be a sufficient basis to convict the
accused on the charge.“
38
35. In her written observations, the Legal Representative of Victim a/0105/06
considers that while the bench may, for the purpose of the warrant of arrest, base
their decision solely on the perception that the Prosecutor has of his case, with

38 ICC-01/04-01/06-748-Conf, paras. 8-13, quoting from The Prosecutor v. Dario Kordić, Case No. IT-95-
14-I, Decision of 10 November 1995, p. 3.
ICC-01/04-01/06-803-tEN 14-05-2007 12/157 SL PT
No. 01/04-01/06 13/157 29 January 2007
Official Court Translation
respect to the confirmation of the charges, the Chamber must establish that “serious
presumptions” exist.39
36. Approaching this from the perspective of the conviction of an accused, the
Defence considers that the evidence presented by the Prosecution must be sufficient
to reasonably sustain a conviction.40
37. In the opinion of the Chamber, the purpose of the confirmation hearing is
limited to committing for trial only those persons against whom sufficiently
compelling charges going beyond mere theory or suspicion have been brought.41 This
mechanism is designed to protect the rights of the Defence against wrongful and
wholly unfounded charges.
38. To define the concept of “substantial grounds to believe”, the Chamber relies
on internationally recognised human rights jurisprudence. In this regard, in its
judgement of 7 July 1987 in Soering v. United Kingdom, the European Court of Human
Rights (ECHR) defined this standard as meaning that “substantial grounds have been
shown for believing.”
42 In a joint partially dissenting opinion appended to the
judgement in Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey, Judges Bratza, Bonello and Hedigan
considered that “substantial grounds to believe” should be defined as “strong
grounds for believing.“
43 Moreover, in that case, the Grand Chamber of the ECHR
assessed the material placed before it as a whole.
44
39. Accordingly, the Chamber considers that for the Prosecution to meet its
evidentiary burden, it must offer concrete and tangible proof demonstrating a clear
line of reasoning underpinning its specific allegations. Furthermore, the “substantial

grounds to believe” standard must enable all the evidence admitted for the purpose
of the confirmation hearing to be assessed as a whole. After an exacting scrutiny of
all the evidence, the Chamber will determine whether it is thoroughly satisfied that
the Prosecution’s allegations are sufficiently strong to commit Thomas Lubanga
Dyilo for trial. In this regard, the Chamber will consider the various witness
statements in the context of the remaining evidence admitted for the purpose of the
confirmation hearing, without however referencing all of them in this decision.
B. Matters relating to the admissibility of evidence and its probative value
1. Preliminary observations
40. The Chamber recalls that, in accordance with the Decision on the schedule and
conduct of the confirmation hearing, rendered on 7 November 2006:45
any item included in the Prosecution Additional List of Evidence filed on 20
October 2006 shall be admitted into evidence for the purpose of the confirmation
hearing, unless it is expressly ruled inadmissible by the Chamber upon a challenge
by any of the participants at the hearing; and
any item included in the Defence List of Evidence filed on 2 November 2006 and
the Defence Additional List of Evidence filed on 7 November 2006 shall be
admitted into evidence for the purpose of the confirmation hearing, unless it is
expressly ruled inadmissible by the Chamber upon a challenge by any of the
participants at the hearing;
41. In addition, in its oral decision of 10 November 2006, rendered pursuant to
rule 122(3) of the Rules, the Chamber considered that:
- Firstly, the Defence challenged the admissibility of all evidence included in the
List of Evidence of the Prosecutor of 20 October 2006, for which redactions were
authorised and, in particular, documents containing redactions concerning the
sources of information of the Prosecutor, as well as the summaries.
- Secondly, the Chamber notes that the first appeal was authorised in a decision of
28 September 2006, and the second on 4 October 2006. The Chamber also notes
that the Defence did not request suspensive effect for these two decisions.
Consequently, the two decisions of the Pre-Trial Chamber are still applicable
[…] subject to the same reservations that I expressed a while ago.
Therefore, parties must be able to present their evidence during the confirmation
hearing. However, the Chamber would like to inform the participants that the
matter of the admissibility of evidence must be attached to the decision on the
merits. In this regard, the Chamber would like to reassure the parties that if the

Appeals Chamber goes against these decisions in whole or in part, the evidence
that is affected by such decision will be automatically declared inadmissible.46
2. Judgements of the Appeals Chamber on the first and second decisions on
the Prosecution requests for redactions under rule 81
a. Items included in the List of Evidence filed by the
Prosecution on 20 October 2006 which are affected by the
First Judgement on Appeal
42. In the Judgment on the appeal of Mr Thomas Lubanga Dyilo against the Decision of
Pre-Trial Chamber I entitled “First Decision on the Prosecution Requests and Amended
Requests for Redactions under Rule 81” (“the First Judgement on Appeal”), rendered by
the Appeals Chamber on 14 December 2006, under the heading “Appropriate Relief”,
the Appeals Chamber stated:
The Appeals Chamber has found that the Impugned Decision lacked sufficient
reasoning in relation to the finding of the Pre-Trial Chamber that the identities of
the witnesses covered by the Impugned Decision should not be disclosed to the
defence. The Appeals Chamber considers that this error materially affects the
Impugned Decision because it cannot be established, on the basis of the reasoning
that was provided, how the Pre-Trial Chamber reached its decision. For that
reason, it is appropriate to reverse the Impugned Decision. As the reversal of the
Impugned Decision on the basis of the first ground of appeal does not entail a
conclusive determination by the Appeals Chamber that the Pre-Trial Chamber
could not have authorised the non-disclosure of the identities of the relevant
witnesses to the defence in the present case, the Pre-Trial Chamber is directed to
decide anew upon the applications that gave rise to the Impugned Decisions,
having regard to the findings of the present judgement.47

46 ICC-01-04-01-06-T-32-EN[10Nov2006Edited], p. 30, lines 1-24.
47 ICC-01/04-01/06-773, para. 53. Furthermore, the Appeals Chamber also pointed out that the
Impugned Decision failed to properly address three of the most important considerations for an
authorisation of non-disclosure of the identity of a witness pursuant to rule 81(4) of the Rules of
Procedure and Evidence: the endangerment of the witness or of members of his or her family that the
disclosure of the identity of the witness may cause; the need to take protective measures; and why the
Pre-Trial Chamber considered that these measures would not be prejudicial to, or inconsistent with,
the rights of the Defence and the requirements of a fair and impartial trial (last sentence of article 68(1)
of the Statute). The Appeals Chamber added that with respect to the endangerment of witnesses or
members of their families, the reasoning of the Pre-Trial Chamber did not provide any indication as to
why the Pre-Trial Chamber expected that the security of witnesses or their families may be
endangered if the witnesses’ identities were disclosed to the appellant. Furthermore, according to the
Appeals Chamber, the Pre-Trial Chamber did not indicate which of the facts before it led the Pre-Trial
Chamber to reach such a conclusion. In relation to the need not to disclose the identities of the
witnesses, the Appeals Chamber noted that the Pre-Trial Chamber only stated that the security
situation in some parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo had an impact on the availability and
feasibility of protective measures, without clarifying the factors which it considered relevant for the

43. As a result, the First Judgement on Appeal reverses the Impugned Decision
which authorised the Prosecution not to disclose to the Defence the identities of the
following witnesses: DRC-OTP-WWWW-0003; DRC-OTP-WWWW-0004; DRC-OTPWWWW-0016; DRC-OTP-WWWW-021; DRC-OTP-WWWW-0024; DRC-OTPWWWW-0026; DRC-OTP-WWWW-0027; DRC-OTP-WWWW-0030; DRC-OTPWWWW-0032; DRC-OTP-WWWW-0034; DRC-OTP-WWWW-0035; DRC-OTPWWWW-0037; DRC-OTP-WWWW-0038; DRC-OTP-WWWW-0040; DRC-OTPWWWW-0041; and DRC-OTP-WWWW-0044.
44. Consequently, the Chamber considers that the First Judgement on Appeal
affects the following items included in the List of Evidence filed by the Prosecution
on 20 October 2006: (i) the summaries of the statements, transcripts of interviews and
Prosecution investigators’ notes and reports of the interviews of the above-referenced
witnesses; and (ii) any related document and video included in Annexes 1 to 9, 12 to
15, 18 to 21 of the “Amended Provision of summary evidence to the Pre-Trial
Chamber”(“the Third Prosecution Application”), filed by the Prosecution on 4
October 2006,48 (with the exception of those previously disclosed to the Defence in
unredacted form).

protection of the witnesses. Finally, the Appeals Chamber considered that the appellant had no
knowledge of the facts relied upon by the Pre-Trial Chamber for its decision and how the Chamber
had applied rule 81(4) of the Rules to the facts of the case. (Ibid., para. 21).
48 According to Annex 22 of the Third Prosecution Application, this includes the following items:
i) Summary of the statement and transcript of the interview of Witness DRC-OTP-WWWW-0003

In the present case, because the Appeals Chamber has determined that the
Impugned Decision lacked sufficient reasoning in relation to the authorisation of
disclosure of witness statements and other documents with redactions pursuant to
rule 81 (2) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, it is appropriate to reverse the
Impugned Decision to the extent that it authorised the disclosure of witness
statements and other documents to the defence with redactions. The Pre-Trial
Chamber should consider the matter anew and provide sufficient reasons for its

decision. The Appeals Chamber considers that it is appropriate to reverse all
authorisations of disclosure with redactions even though the first ground of appeal
related only to the factual reasoning for rulings pursuant to rule 81 (2) of the Rules
of Procedure and Evidence because the Impugned Decision did not clearly indicate
under which provision the redactions were authorised, nor did the Pre-Trial
Chamber identify in the Decision Granting Leave to Appeal which parts of its
disposition in the Impugned Decision it considered to be affected by the first
ground of appeal.

authorised the Prosecution to disclose redacted versions to the Defence. Accordingly,
it affects the following items included in the Amended List of Evidence filed by the

53 ICC-01/04-01/06-774. According to the Appeals Chamber, the reasoning in the Impugned Decision is
insufficient because it is not clear from the reasoning what facts, in the evaluation of the Pre-Trial
Chamber, justified the authorisation of the requested redactions. The Appeals Chamber considered
that to a large extent, the Pre-Trial Chamber had limited itself only to reciting the substance of the
provisions concerning authorisations of disclosure with redactions without providing any information
as to how it had applied these provisions to the facts of the case. According to the Appeals Chamber,
the Impugned Decision failed to set out expressly which redactions were being authorised under rule
81(2) of the Rules. The Appeals Chamber added that it was possible to surmise that certain redactions
had been authorised under that provision, but nowhere is the factual and legal basis for those
redactions explicitly considered together. Moreover, according to the Appeals Chamber, the Pre-Trial
Chamber did not address, even in general terms, why the Chamber considered that the disclosure of
the sources of the Prosecutor and any other matters in relation to which it authorised redactions could
prejudice further investigations. Ibid., para. 32.

c. Items included in the List of Evidence filed by the
Prosecution on 20 October 2006 which are not affected by the
First and Second Judgements on Appeal
48. The Chamber considers that the First and Second Judgements on Appeal have
no effect on the statements of witnesses [REDACTED], which were disclosed in full
to the Defence in unredacted form.
49. The Chamber also considers that the First and Second Judgements on Appeal
do not affect the statements of witnesses [REDACTED], which were redacted
pursuant to rule 81(2) of the Rules, or any documents related thereto. In fact, these
redactions were authorised by the Single Judge in her Decision on the Prosecution
Amended Application pursuant to Rule 81(2),
56 from which neither party has sought
leave to appeal.
50. The Chamber further considers that the First and Second Judgements on
Appeal do not affect the redacted statements of [REDACTED], Kristine Peduto and
[REDACTED], the transcript of [REDACTED] interview and the related documents
for the following reasons:
a. The two redacted statements of witness [REDACTED] were disclosed to
the Defence only in redacted form pursuant to rule 81(2) of the Rules. In
fact, these redactions were authorised by the Single Judge on 2 August
2006 in her Decision on the Prosecution Amended Application pursuant to Rule

81(2)57 and in her 5 October 2006 Decision on the Prosecution Application of 5
October 2006.
58 Neither party has sought leave to appeal these decisions.
b. The redacted statement of witness Kristine Peduto and the related
documents were disclosed to the Defence only in redacted form pursuant
to rule 81(2) or rule 82(3) of the Rules. These redactions were authorised by
the Single Judge in her decision of 10 October 2006.59 Neither party has
sought leave to appeal the decision.
c. The redacted statement of [REDACTED] and the redacted transcript of the
interview of [REDACTED] were disclosed to the Defence only in redacted
form pursuant to rule 81(2) of the Rules. These redactions were authorised
by the Single Judge in her 2 August 2006 Decision on the Prosecution
Amended Application pursuant to Rule 81(2)60 and in her 3 November 2006
Corrigendum to Decision on the Prosecution Application pursuant to Rule 81(2)
of 3 November 2006.
61 Neither party has sought leave to appeal these
decisions.
51. In principle, the authorised redactions to the statements of [REDACTED],
Kristine Peduto and [REDACTED] and to the transcript of the interview of
[REDACTED] and related documents are not subject to the First and Second
Judgements on Appeal.
52. The guiding principles set by the First and Second Judgements on Appeal
should however be applied to some of these redactions for the following reasons:
a. the redactions were authorised by the Chamber after the Impugned
Decisions were rendered;

Official Court Translation
b. the reasoning underlying the said redactions was some to extent linked to
the reasons for the Impugned Decisions.
The application of these guiding principles is set out in Annex 1 of this decision.
53. In addition, the First and Second Judgements on Appeal direct the Chamber,
almost three weeks after the confirmation hearing, to decide anew upon the
numerous Prosecution Rule 81 applications. The Chamber holds the view that the
requirement that proceedings be conducted expeditiously, which, as the Appeals
Chamber has stated, constitutes an attribute of the right to a fair trial,62 calls for a
prior determination whether the “sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds
to believe” standard had been met having regard to evidence which had been
admitted for the purpose of the confirmation hearing, but which was not affected by
the Appeals Chamber judgements.
54. The Chamber will decide anew upon the numerous Prosecution Rule 81
applications which are affected by the First and Second Judgements on Appeal only
if it is satisfied that the “sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to
believe” standard cannot be met, bearing in mind that such a review will take several
months to complete. In this regard, the Chamber considers that if in the future, the
Prosecution filed dozens of Rule 81 applications concerning thousands of pages, it
would be difficult for the Court to reconcile the application of the Appeals
Chamber’s guiding principles with the requirement that proceedings be conducted
expeditiously.
55. The approach adopted by the Chamber not only enables compliance with the
requirement that proceedings be conducted expeditiously but also ensures that no
prejudice flows to the parties. With respect to the Prosecution, the fact that the
evidence affected by the First and Second Judgements on Appeal is not taken into
account at this stage has no bearing on its potential admissibility at trial. Nor, in the

62 Judgment on the Prosecutor’s Application for Extraordinary Review of Pre-Trial Chamber I’s 31 March 2006
Decision Denying Leave to Appeal, rendered on 13 July 2006, ICC-01/04-01/06-168.

view of the Chamber, is this approach prejudicial to the Defence, because the
evidence affected is evidence on which the Prosecution intended to rely at the
confirmation hearing.
63 Hence, as long as the Chamber takes into consideration only
those parts of the evidence that the Defence has highlighted as being of a potentially
exculpatory nature, no prejudice will flow to the Defence.
d. The special case of Witnesses DRC-OTP-WWWW-0033, DRCOTP-WWWW-0035 and DRC-OTP-WWWW-0037
56. The Chamber recalls that in the Second Decision on the Prosecution Requests and
Amended Requests for Redactions under Rule 8164 and in the Decision concerning the
Prosecution Proposed Summary Evidence,
65 it had ordered the Prosecution to inform
certain witnesses that it intended to rely on their statements, or on the reports of their
interviews, for the purpose of the hearing concerning the confirmation of the charges
against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo. In a document filed on 17 November 2006,66 the
Prosecution informed the Chamber that it had so informed all witnesses, save for
Witnesses DRC-OTP-WWWW-0033, DRC-OTP-WWWW-0035 and DRC-OTPWWWW-0037, and that those three witnesses had not been informed in order to
protect their personal security.
57. As the Chamber has already stated:

63 Except documents ICC-01/04-01/06-409-Conf-Exp-Anx1, ICC-01/04-01/06-409-Conf-Exp-Anx13, ICC01/04-01/06-409-Conf-Exp-Anx14, ICC-01/04-01/06-409-Conf-Exp 17, ICC-01/04-01/06-Conf-Exp-Anx24,
ICC-01/04-01/06-384-Conf-Exp-Anx12, ICC-01/04-01/06-384-Conf-Exp-Anx13 and ICC-01/04-01/06-384-
Conf-Exp-Anx14. Regarding documents ICC-01/04-01/06-409-Conf-Exp1, ICC-01/04-01/06-409-ConfExp13, ICC-01/04-01/06-409-Conf-Exp-Anx14, ICC-01/04-01/06-409-Conf-Exp 17 and ICC-01/04-01/06-
Conf-Exp-Anx24, the Second Decision on the Prosecution Requests and Amended Requests for Redactions
under Rule 81 expressly states that “none of the documents seems to have any potentially exculpatory
information, and thus the proposed redactions to such documents do not affect any potentially
exculpatory information“ (pp. 14-15). Furthermore, regarding documents ICC-01/04-01/06-384-ConfExp-Anx12, ICC-01/04-01/06-384-Conf-Exp-Anx13 and ICC-01/04-01/06-384-Conf-Exp-Anx14,
permission to redact allowed only the concealment of the handwritten initials of certain Prosecution
witnesses, which were not part of the original document, in order to prevent the said witnesses from
being identified.

According to article 69(4) of the Statute, the Chamber may rule on the admissibility
of the evidence on which the parties intend to rely at the confirmation hearing
taking into account other factors in addition to relevance, probative value and
prejudice to a fair trial or to a fair evaluation of the testimony of a witness; and
that, in the view of the Chamber, in a scenario like the one described above, and
considering the limited scope of the confirmation hearing, adequate protection of
the witnesses on whom the parties intend to rely at the confirmation hearing is one
of those additional factors.67
58. The Chamber recalls that article 68(1) of the Statute requires all organs of the
Court to take, within the scope of their respective functions, appropriate measures to
protect the safety, physical and psychological well-being, dignity and privacy of
witnesses. Moreover, rule 86 of the Rules stipulates that the Chamber, in making any
direction or order, and other organs of the Court, in performing their functions under
the Statute or the Rules, shall take into account the needs of all witnesses in
accordance with article 68 of the Statute.
59. In the view of the Chamber, the first and foremost measure required under
article 68(1) of the Statute and rule 86 of the Rules is to inform each prospective
witness of the fact that a party intends to rely on his or her statement, or the report or
transcript of his or her interview for the purpose of the confirmation hearing in a
specific case. Hence, if, as in the case before the Chamber, with respect to Witnesses
DRC-OTP-WWWW-0033, DRC-OTP-WWWW-0035 and DRC-OTP-WWWW-0037,
the information was not provided to the said witnesses in order to protect them
appropriately, the Chamber considers that their statements and transcripts or reports
of their interviews must be ruled inadmissible for the purpose of the confirmation
hearing. Accordingly, the Chamber will in no case decide anew upon those parts of
the Prosecution Rule 81 applications relating to these three witnesses.
3. Challenges by the parties relating to the admissibility and probative value
of the evidence admitted for the purpose of the confirmation hearing
60. Immediately prior to and at the confirmation hearing, the Defence challenged
the admissibility of a number of items included in the Prosecution List of Evidence or
proposed by the Prosecution at the confirmation hearing. With respect to most of the

67 ICC-01/04-01/06-437.
ICC-01/04-01/06-803-tEN 14-05-2007 26/157 SL PT

Official Court Translation
items, the Defence asserts, in the alternative, that, even if they were to be admitted, at
best, only limited probative value could be attached to them.
68 Likewise, the
Prosecution challenged the admissibility of some of the items included in the List of
Evidence filed by the Defence on 2 November 2006 or items proposed by the Defence
at the confirmation hearing.
61. Given the relationship that article 69(4) of the Statute establishes between
issues relating to the admissibility of evidence and issues relating to its probative
value, the Chamber will consider the parties’ concerns with regard to both sets of
issues in the same section.
a. Issues raised by the Defence
i) Items seized from [REDACTED]’s home
62. One of the main procedural issues in this case concerns the Prosecution’s use
of evidence alleged by the Defence to have been procured in violation of Congolese
rules of procedure and internationally recognised human rights. At the confirmation
hearing, the Prosecutor relied on evidence seized (“the Items Seized“) from the home
of [REDACTED]. On 2 November 2006, the Single Judge ordered the Prosecution to,
inter alia, provide the Chamber with a comprehensive list of the Items Seized.
69 On 6

68 The items affected by the Defence requests are:
a. Any items which are part of the so-called “[REDACTED] documents“;
b. Any items which are part of the materials seized by Uruguayan MONUC forces on 6
September 2003;
c. Any items proposed by the Prosecution as alternative evidence to items included among the
“[REDACTED] Documents“ or among the materials seized by Uruguayan MONUC forces on
6 September 2003;
d. Any items for which no information relating to the chain of custody and transmission has
been provided by the Prosecution, including a number of documents, video excerpts and emails;
e. Any items or parts thereof containing anonymous hearsay evidence, including (a) the
testimony of Kristine Peduto, (b) reports of non-governmental organisations, (c) press articles
and media reports, and (d) redacted statements and summary evidence, if the identity of the
witness has not been disclosed to the Defence;
f. Certificates concerning the six child soldiers whose cases are detailed in the Document
Containing the Charges under the heading “Individual Cases”.
69 ICC-01/04-01/06-647. These instructions were reiterated at the confirmation hearing on
10 November 2006 (ICC-01-04-01-06-T-32-EN[10Nov2006Edited], p. 30, lines 18-22).

November 2006, the Prosecution filed the list of Items Seized70 with the Chamber and,
on 13 November 2006, it informed the Chamber that 71 of the documents in its List of
Evidence were among the Items Seized.
71 In a request filed on 7 November 2006,72 the
Defence had asked that the Items Seized be excluded from the Prosecution List of
Evidence (“the Defence Request”). According to the Defence, numerous items were
allegedly seized from [REDACTED]’s home while he was being detained on the
orders of the national authorities.
63. The search during which the items were seized was conducted by the
Congolese authorities in the presence of an investigator from the Office of the
Prosecutor (OTP). In a decision rendered subsequently, the [REDACTED] Court of
Appeal stated, inter alia, that it would not take the Items Seized into consideration on
the ground that the search and seizure had been conducted in breach of the
Congolese Code of Procedure.73
64. The Prosecution objected to the Defence Request on the ground that it had no
legal basis.
74 Furthermore, on 22 November 2006, the Prosecution indicated that, were
the Chamber to rule that the Items Seized were inadmissible for the purpose of the
confirmation hearing, a number of items on its List of Evidence could be substituted
therefor and considered as supportive of its case.75
65. In their closing statements at the confirmation hearing, the Legal
Representatives of Victims a/0001/06, a/0002/06 and a/0003/06 also objected to the
Defence Request on the ground, inter alia, that the Defence cannot rely on the
judgement of the [REDACTED] Court of Appeal because it had “no effect.”

66. On 24 November 2006, the Defence requested that the Prosecution’s further
response to the Defence request pursuant to article 69(7) of the Statute be ruled
inadmissible or, in the alternative, that the Defence be granted leave to reply to it.77
67. First, the Chamber considers the Defence objection to be unfounded because
the alternative items suggested by the Prosecution in its 22 November 2006 filing
were already included in the Amended List of Evidence filed by the Prosecution on
20 October 2006, even if they were not used at the hearing. In this respect, the
Chamber refers to its Decision on the schedule and conduct of the confirmation hearing78 in
which it held that unless it had expressly ruled an item inadmissible upon a challenge
by any of the participants at the hearing, and provided that item was included in the
Prosecution Amended List of Evidence, the Chamber may rely on it whether or not
the Prosecution decides to present it at the confirmation hearing.
68. In addition, the Chamber notes that the Defence alternative request seeking
leave to reply is moot in so far as the Defence had the opportunity to submit its
observations both orally at the confirmation hearing and in writing in its brief filed
on 6 December 2006.79
69. First, the Chamber observes that under article 21(1)(c) of the Statute, where
articles 21(1)(a) and (b) do not apply, it shall apply general principles of law derived
by the Court from national laws. Having said that, the Chamber considers that the
Court is not bound by the decisions of national courts on evidentiary matters.
Therefore, the mere fact that a Congolese court has ruled on the unlawfulness of the
search and seizure conducted by the national authorities cannot be considered
binding on the Court. This is clear from article 69(8) which states that “[w]hen

79 The Chamber notes that the Defence discussed this issue in its “Defence Brief on matters the Defence
raised during the confirmation hearing‐Legal Observations”, filed on 7 December 2006, ICC-01/04-
01/06-764, para. 51.

deciding on the relevance or admissibility of evidence collected by a State, the Court
shall not rule on the application of the State’s national law.“
80
70. As the Defence Request is based on article 69(7) of the Rome Statute,81 the
Chamber must determine whether the evidence was obtained in violation of
internationally recognised human rights.
71. According to the documents filed by the Defence, the search and seizure at
[REDACTED]’s home was conducted by the Congolese authorities as part of national
criminal proceedings brought against [REDACTED] for counterfeiting money.82 No
evidence has been brought to support the Defence allegation that “the search was
motivated by discrimination on political or ethnic grounds”
83 or that “it is therefore
not difficult to suspect that the local proceedings were merely a diversionary tactic,
which were used to justify the provision of the materials in question to the
Prosecution.“
84
72. However, in determining whether there has been a violation of internationally
recognised human rights, it should be noted that, in its judgement on the
unlawfulness of the search and seizure, the [REDACTED] Court relied for its finding
on a single precedent which, in addition to being more than 20 years old, is based,
not on international human rights treaties as claimed by Counsel for the Defence in
the above-mentioned appeal,85 but on a breach of article 33 of the Congolese Criminal

80 According to one commentator on the Rome Statute, “There is therefore a close link between
paragraphs 7 and 8. Whereas a violation of internationally recognized human rights in principle
qualifies as a ground for exclusion of evidence, a violation of national laws on evidence does not. The
reason for that is that the Court should not be burdened with decisions on matters of purely national
law.“ (BEHRENS, H.J., “The Trial Proceedings“, in The International Criminal Court: The Making of the
Rome Statute, The Hague, Kluwer Law International, 1999, p. 246).
81 Under this provision, evidence obtained by means of a violation of the Statute or internationally
recognised human rights is not admissible if a) the violation casts substantial doubt on the reliability
of the evidence; or b) the admission of the evidence would be antithetical to and would seriously
damage the integrity of the proceedings.
82 In Annex 1 of document ICC-01/04-01/06-726-Conf, filed by the Prosecution, it is stated that the
search and seizure was conducted in the context of criminal proceedings for murder and torture.

Procedure Code which provides that “[TRANSLATION] [H]ouse searches shall be
conducted in the presence of the alleged perpetrator of the offence and the person in
whose home or residence they are conducted, unless they are not present or refuse to
attend.” Accordingly, “[TRANSLATION] where the seizure of the disputed item was
conducted in the absence of the person concerned who, being under arrest, was at all
times available to the prosecuting authorities and could therefore have been taken at
any time to the premises searched,” such interference has been considered unlawful.
73. Thus, in order to determine whether there has been an illegality amounting to
a violation of internationally recognised human rights or merely an infringement of
domestic rules of procedure, guidance should be sought from international human
rights jurisprudence.
74. The right to privacy is enshrined in Article 17 of the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and
Article 11 of the Inter-American Convention on Human Rights. In addition to having
ratified the various international human rights instruments, many African countries
have also enshrined the right to privacy in their constitutions.86
75. According to these international instruments, the right to privacy and to
protection against unlawful interference and infringement of privacy is a
fundamental internationally recognised right. However, it cannot be viewed as an
absolute right in so far as these same instruments provide indications of what may be
considered as a “lawful” interference with the fundamental right to privacy.87

86 See article 31 of the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, adopted on 18 February
2006. No search whatsoever may be authorised except as provided by law. It should also be noted that
Congo ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1983.
87 In Camenzind v. Switzerland, for example, the ECHR decided that States “may consider it necessary to
resort to measures such as searches of residential premises and seizures in order to obtain physical
evidence of certain offences. The Court will assess whether the reasons adduced to justify such
measures were relevant and sufficient and whether the aforementioned proportionality principle has
been adhered to. […] the Court must consider the particular circumstances of each case in order to
determine whether, in the concrete case, the interference in question was proportionate to the aim
pursued.“ (Judgement of 16 December 1997, Application No. 21353/93, para. 45).

76. Accordingly, in considering the reasons advanced in support of the search and
seizure conducted at [REDACTED]’s home, the Chamber recalls that at the time,
criminal proceedings were being taken against [REDACTED] for counterfeiting
money and, potentially, for murder and torture.88 It appears that the process was
initiated on the orders of a member of the Office of the State Prosecutor of the
Tribunal de Grande Instance of Bunia in a bid to gather evidence for the purpose of the
criminal proceedings. Since the judgement of the [REDACTED] Court contains no
other indication, it appears that the order to conduct the search and seizure was
given by the competent authority in order to gather evidence for the purpose of
lawful criminal proceedings.
77. There is nothing in this case to indicate that the national authorities allegedly
used force, threats or any other form of abuse to gain access to [REDACTED]’s home.
In fact, the OTP investigator who attended the seizure pointed out in his statement
that [REDACTED]’s wife was present at the time of the search and seizure and was
present throughout the operation.89 This statement is therefore consistent with the
fact that there has been no complaint for improper interference by force.
78. As a result, the Chamber finds, as stated in the [REDACTED] Court’s decision
based solely on article 33 of the Congolese Criminal Procedure Code, that the
unlawfulness of the search and seizure conducted in [REDACTED]’s absence was a
breach of a procedural rule, but cannot be considered so serious as to amount to a
violation of internationally recognised human rights.
79. The Chamber will now determine whether the search and seizure conducted
at [REDACTED]’s home adhered to the principle of proportionality. Recent ECHR
judgements confirm that proportionality is one of the requirements for lawful
interference with the right to privacy. In Miailhe, for example, the ECHR observed
that “[t]he seizures made on the applicants’ premises were wholesale and, above all,

88 This is what appears to emerge from the Statement of [REDACTED] – see Annex 1 of document ICC01/04-01/06-726-Conf, para. 8.

indiscriminate, to such an extent that the customs considered several thousand
documents to be of no relevance to their inquiries and returned them to the
applicants.“
90 For this reason, it found that the principle of proportionality had not
been adhered to and that, as a result, the right to privacy had been infringed and that
the coercive action was unlawful.
80. The Chamber considers that in the instant case, it is clear from the list of
documents and items seized by the Congolese authorities and handed over to the
Prosecution’s investigator that hundreds of documents were confiscated, including
correspondence, photographs, invitations, legislation, reports, diaries and “personal
information”.
91 There is no means of determining the relevance, if any, of the
documents and items seized from [REDACTED]’s home to the Congolese authorities.
However, the information before the Chamber suggests that the Prosecution seemed
just as interested, perhaps even more interested, in the items in question92 and it
appears that the Prosecution’s presence influenced the conduct of the search and
seizure.
81. Accordingly, the Chamber finds that the search and the seizure of hundreds of
documents and items pertaining to the Situation in the DRC, conducted in order to
gather evidence for the purpose of domestic criminal proceedings infringed the
principle of proportionality sanctioned by the ECHR, first, because the interference
did not appear to be proportionate to the objective sought by the national authorities
and secondly, because of the indiscriminate nature of the search and seizure
involving hundreds of items.93
82. Accordingly, although all violations of procedural rules do not necessarily
result in a violation of internationally recognised human rights, in this case, the
Chamber finds that, in light of ECHR jurisprudence, the infringement of the principle

Amended List of Evidence.

of proportionality can be characterised as a violation of internationally recognised
human rights.
83. Having found that the Items Seized were obtained without regard to the
principle of proportionality and in violation of internationally recognised human
rights, the Chamber must now determine whether such a violation can justify the
exclusion of the Items Seized.
84. The Chamber observes that article 69(7) of the Statute rejects the notion that
evidence procured in violation of internationally recognised human rights should be
automatically excluded. Consequently, the judges have the discretion to seek an
appropriate balance between the Statute’s fundamental values in each concrete case.94
85. The first limb of the alternative embodied in article 69(7)(a) of the Statute deals
with the impact of the unlawful method used to gather evidence on the reliability of
such evidence, because “some forms of illegality or violations of human rights create
the danger that the evidence, such as a confession obtained from a person during
interrogation, may not be truthful or reliable as it may have been proffered as a result
of the duress arising from the circumstances of the violation.“
95 However, in the
present case, the Chamber holds the view that the infringement of the principle of
proportionality did not affect the reliability of the evidence seized from
[REDACTED]’s home on the ground that had the search and seizure been conducted

94 According to some commentators, “some delegations wanted to exclude evidence obtained by
means of a violation of human rights, but this formulation was regarded as too broad.“ The drafters of
the Statute opted for a narrower formula, under which the Court “will have to distinguish between
minor infringements of procedural safeguards and heavier violations“. Consequently, “violations of
specific national rules on the conduct of an interrogation or the like were not matters upon which the
Court should base a decision on exclusion.“ (BEHRENS H-J., “The Trial Proceedings “, in The
international Criminal Court, The Making of the Rome Statute, The Hague, Kluwer Law international,
1999, p. 246). Paragraph 7, on the other hand, “specifically stipulates specific predicate events
regarding the manner of collection of the evidence and detrimental effects on the trial process which, if
they are found to exist, justify exclusion. Nevertheless, the determination of the existence of those
predicate events or effects necessitates the exercise of evaluation and, thereby, discretion by the
Court.“ Piragoff, Donald K, in Commentary on the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Otto
Triffterer (ed.), Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft/Baden-Baden, 1999, p. 914).

in full adherence to the principle of proportionality, the content of the Items Seized
would not have been different.
86. The second limb of the alternative embodied in article 69(7)(b) of the Statute
does not pertain to the reliability of the evidence seized; rather, it concerns the
adverse effect that the admission of such evidence could have on the integrity of the
proceedings. The Chamber recalls that in the fight against impunity, it must ensure
an appropriate balance between the rights of the accused and the need to respond to
victims’ and the international community’s expectations. According to a comparative
study of various European legal systems, the issue of the admissibility of illegally
obtained evidence raises contradictory and complex matters of principle.96 Although
no consensus has emerged on this issue in international human rights jurisprudence,
the majority view is that only a serious human rights violation can lead to the
exclusion of evidence.97
87. Regarding the rules applicable before the international criminal tribunals and
their jurisprudence, the generally accepted solution “is to provide for the exclusion of
evidence by judges only in cases in which very serious breaches have occurred,
leading to substantial unreliability of the evidence presented.”
98
88. In The Prosecutor v. Radoslav Brđanin,
99 the International Criminal Tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) undertook the same analysis that the Chamber is

96 Ibid., pp. 603-610.
97 The ECHR found that the assessment of evidence falls essentially under national legislation. In
Schenk v. Switzerland, it decided that it “cannot exclude as a matter of principle and in the abstract that
unlawfully obtained evidence […] may be admissible“, and held that it had to ascertain only whether
the trial as a whole was fair (Judgement of 12 July 1988, Application No. 10862/84, para. 46). See also
Saunders v. United Kingdom, Judgement of 17 December 1996, Application No. 19187/91; Khan v. United

Netherlands, Judgement of 23 April 1997, Application No. 21363/93. This reasoning was also followed
by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in the Ivcher Bronstein case, Judgement, 6 February
2001. In the same vein, see the Castillo Páez, Loayza Tamayo and Paniagua cases.

undertaking in the present case, taking into consideration the views of legal
commentators, comparative law and the jurisprudence of human rights courts.100
Relying on the precedent established in The Prosecutor v. Delalić,
101 the ICTY Trial
Chamber recalled that “it would constitute a dangerous obstacle to the
administration of justice if evidence which is relevant and of probative value could
not be admitted merely because of a minor breach of procedural rules which the Trial
Chamber is not bound to apply.”
102 Having determined that the evidence at issue was
relevant to the case, the Brđanin Trial Chamber admitted the evidence.
89. Accordingly, the Chamber endorses the human rights and ICTY jurisprudence
which focuses on the balance to be achieved between the seriousness of the violation
and the fairness of the trial as a whole.
90. Hence, for the purpose of the confirmation hearing, the Chamber decides to
admit the Items Seized into evidence. Moreover, the Chamber recalls the limited
scope of this hearing, bearing in mind that the admission of evidence at this stage is
without prejudice to the Trial Chamber’s exercise of its functions and powers to
make a final determination as to the admissibility and probative value of the Items
Seized from [REDACTED]’s home.

100 The point was made that “admitting illegally obtained intercepts into evidence does not, in and of
itself, necessarily amount to seriously damaging the integrity of the proceedings.“ (Ibid., para. 61).

conclusion that […] evidence obtained by eavesdropping on an enemy’s telephone calls during the
course of a war is certainly not within the conduct which is referred to in Rule 95. It’s not antithetical
to and certainly would not seriously damage the integrity of the proceedings.“

ii) Items seized by Uruguayan MONUC forces on 6 September
2003
91. The Defence requests that the evidence originally seized by Uruguayan
MONUC forces on 6 September 2003 and included in the Prosecution List of
Evidence be excluded.103
92. The Prosecution assured the Chamber that none of the evidence included in its
Amended List of Evidence was originally seized by Uruguayan MONUC forces on 6
September 2003.
93. The Defence has not provided sufficient evidence to lead to the conclusion that
the Prosecution List of Evidence includes evidence that was seized by Uruguayan
MONUC forces.
104
94. Consequently, the Chamber is not bound to consider whether the items
originally seized by Uruguayan MONUC forces on 6 September 2003 are admissible
under article 69(7) of the Statute for the purpose of the confirmation hearing.
iii) Evidence on the chain of custody and transmission for which
the Prosecution has not provided any information
95. The Defence has requested the Chamber not to admit any item in the
Prosecution List of Evidence for which no information pertaining to the chain of
transmission has been provided.105 In the view of the Defence, the Prosecution’s lack
of diligence in this regard casts doubt on the authenticity of these items. If the items
are nevertheless admitted, the Defence requests that they be corroborated by other
evidence before the “reasonable grounds to believe” test can be considered to have
been satisfied.106 In this regard, the Defence submits that the Chamber should attach

relatively little probative value to any document or video excerpt107 whose
authenticity has not been confirmed by a witness.108
96. The Chamber notes that under article 69(4), it has the power to rule on the
admissibility of any evidence and the probative value thereof. Moreover, nothing in
the Statute or the Rules expressly states that the absence of information about the
chain of custody and transmission affects the admissibility or probative value of
Prosecution evidence.
97. Under the framework established by the Statute and the Rules, the Chamber
notes that, at the stage of the confirmation hearing, the scope of which is limited to
determining whether or not a person should be committed for trial, it is necessary to
assume that the material included in the parties’ Lists of Evidence is authentic. Thus,
unless a party provides information which can reasonably cast doubt on the
authenticity of certain items presented by the opposing party, such items must be
considered authentic in the context of the confirmation hearing. This is without
prejudice to the probative value that could be attached to such evidence in the overall
assessment of the evidence admitted for the purpose of this confirmation hearing.
98. The Chamber notes that in this case, the Defence did nothing more than raise a
general objection to the admissibility of all Prosecution evidence for which no
information pertaining to the chain of custody and transmission had been provided,
without addressing specific items or providing the reasons for its objection.109
Accordingly, the Chamber considers that the Defence has not sufficiently
substantiated its request that some Prosecution evidence be excluded or, in the
alternative, that lesser probative value be attached to it.

iv) Anonymous hearsay evidence and accessibility to the sources
of information contained in certain items of evidence
99. The Defence submits that it is unable to have access to the sources which
provided the information contained in a number of items included in the Prosecution
List of Evidence such as: i) the redacted versions of witness statements, transcripts of
interviews, notes and reports of witness interviews prepared by OTP investigators; ii)
summaries of evidence; iii) certain parts of Kristine Peduto’s testimony; iv) reports by
non-governmental organisations; v) e-mails; and vi) press articles. In the view of the
Defence, these items are anonymous hearsay, and it is impossible for the Defence to
ascertain the truthfulness and authenticity of the information therein contained.
Accordingly, it requests that the Chamber rule this evidence inadmissible or, in the
alternative, that only limited probative value be attached to it.
110
100. Under article 69(4) of the Statute, the Chamber has the discretion to rule on the
admissibility of any evidence, “taking into account, inter alia, the probative value of
the evidence and any prejudice that such evidence may cause to a fair trial or to a fair
evaluation of the testimony of a witness.”
101. The Chamber also notes that there is nothing in the Statute or the Rules which
expressly provides that evidence which can be considered hearsay from anonymous
sources is inadmissible per se. In addition, the Appeals Chamber has accepted that,
for the purpose of the confirmation hearing, it is possible to use certain items of
evidence which may contain anonymous hearsay, such as redacted versions of
witness statements.
111
102. Furthermore, ECHR jurisprudence evinces that the European Convention does
not preclude reliance at the investigation stage of criminal proceedings on sources
such as anonymous informants. Nevertheless, the ECHR specifies that the
subsequent use of anonymous statements as sufficient evidence to found a conviction

is a different matter in that it can be irreconcilable with Article 6 of the European
Convention, particularly if the conviction is based to a decisive extent on anonymous
statements.112
103. Accordingly, the Chamber considers that objections pertaining to the use of
anonymous hearsay evidence do not go to the admissibility of the evidence, but only
to its probative value.
104. In its Second Decision on the Prosecution Requests and Amended Requests for
Redactions under Rule 81, the Chamber held, in this respect:
that, without prior adequate disclosure to Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, the Prosecution
cannot rely on those parts of the documents, witness statements and transcripts of
witness interviews for which redactions are authorised in the present decision; and
that the probative value of the unredacted parts of the said documents, witness
statements and transcripts of witness interviews may be diminished as a result of
the redactions proposed by the Prosecution and authorised by the Chamber.
113
105. Moreover, in the Decision concerning the Prosecution Proposed Summary of
Evidence, the Chamber held that:
in relation to the summary evidence on which the Prosecution is authorised to rely
at the confirmation hearing in the present decision, the Prosecution cannot at the
confirmation hearing rely on any information which does not appear in the
summary evidence, such as the identity, position and other identifying features of
the relevant Prosecution witnesses; that, moreover, summary evidence – as
opposed to redacted versions of witness statements, transcripts of witness
interviews and investigators' notes and reports of witness interviews – is drafted
by the Prosecution; and that these factors shall necessarily have an impact on the
probative value of the summary evidence authorised in the present decision.
114
106. Regarding Kristine Peduto’s testimony, NGO reports, e-mails and press
articles which contain anonymous hearsay evidence, the Chamber will determine
their probative value in light of other evidence which was also admitted for the
purpose of the confirmation hearing. However, mindful of the difficulties that such
evidence may present to the Defence in relation to the possibility of ascertaining its

truthfulness and authenticity, the Chamber decides that, as a general rule, it will use
such anonymous hearsay evidence only to corroborate other evidence.
v) Attestations relating to the six child soldiers whose cases are
detailed in the Document Containing the Charges
107. The Defence takes issue with the admissibility and relevance of the
attestations of birth introduced by the Prosecution to prove the age of witnesses
[REDACTED].
115 According to the Defence, these attestations are inadmissible and
are invalid under Congolese law, given that under Law No. 2181/010 of 1 August
1987, the age of a person can be determined only on the basis of his or her record of
birth.116
108. The Defence also refers to the legal solution used where a person has never
had a record of birth. In this respect, the Defence acknowledges that:
a somewhat parallel practice has developed in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo whereby anyone who does not possess a record of birth may obtain an
attestation of birth from the civil status registrar of their place of residence. […]
However, an attestation is merely a confirmation of a fact or an obligation by a
third party on the basis of statements made to that third party. Unlike a record of
birth, an attestation of birth has no legal status and cannot be set up against third
parties.
117
109. The Prosecution does not dispute the fact that these “certificates do not fully
comply with Congolese law,”
118 but maintains that these attestations of birth are of
some probative value since they were issued by the Congolese authorities.
119
110. The Chamber recalls that under article 69(4) of the Statute, it has the discretion
to rule on the admissibility and probative value of any item included in the parties’
Lists of Evidence, in accordance with internationally recognised human rights as
provided for in article 21(3) of the Statute.

111. The Chamber considers that for the purpose of ruling on the admissibility and
probative value of evidence pertaining to a person’s civil status, it must pay
particular attention to the context in which the evidence was gathered, particularly in
light of the fact that in some countries, civil status records, such as attestations of
birth, marriage certificates or death certificates may not be available.
112. In this respect, in its decision on reparations in Aloeboetoe et al. v. Suriname, the
Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) noted that marriages and births are
not always registered and in those cases where they are registered, sufficient data is
not provided to fully document the relationship between persons.120
113. More recently, in dealing with the identification of victims who were to
receive reparations, the IACHR held that the latter would be recognised if they
showed a record of birth, proof of residence, a marriage certificate or any other
document issued by an authority and mentioning one of the victims.121
114. This jurisprudence reflects the approach that while birth certificates issued by
the competent authorities in accordance with domestic legislation are the best means
of proving a person’s age, they do not constitute the sole means of providing such
proof. In the view of the Chamber, this is because a more flexible approach for
determining the admissibility and probative value of such evidence is the only
approach which is consistent with the requirement to fully respect the specificities of
the cultures and customs of the world’s different peoples.
115. Accordingly, in light of the particular situation of witnesses [REDACTED],
and because their attestations of birth were issued by the civil status registrar of the

town of Bunia,122 the Chamber considers that these attestations must be admitted as
evidence for the purpose of the confirmation hearing.
116. In addition, the Chamber considers that the probative value of these
attestations must be determined as part of the assessment of the totality of the
evidence admitted for the purpose of the confirmation hearing.
117. In this regard, the Chamber notes that the attestations of birth of [REDACTED]
showing that they were under the age of fifteen years when the events referred to in
their statements occurred, are corroborated by other evidence such as the children’s
own statements.
vi) Defence challenge to the credibility of children’s evidence and
Kristine Peduto‘s entire testimony
118. Relying on several grounds,123 the Defence challenged the credibility and
reliability of the statements made by children and Kristine Peduto’s entire testimony,
on which the Prosecution relied to substantiate the charges against Thomas Lubanga
Dyilo.
119. The Chamber takes note of all the Defence challenges concerning children’s
statements and Kristine Peduto’s testimony. However, the Chamber observes that a
large number of these challenges actually proceed from matters of a peripheral
nature which do not really go to the substance of the children’s and Kristine Peduto’s
statements.
124

122 In many countries, including the DRC, a document issued by the competent national authorities is
presumed reliable and the burden of proving that it is false or that its contents are inaccurate is on the
party making such an allegation.
123 See ICC-01/04-01/06-759-Conf-tEN. See also ICC-01/04-01/06-T-42-CONF-EN[22Nov2006Edited],
p. 2, line 12 to p. 64, line 19.
124 The Chamber is not satisfied that the statements of these child witnesses, for example, are not
credible specifically because they “provided names of commanders who were either no longer alive or
could not have been physically present at the time, or gave accounts of implausible trips within Ituri,
“heroic” actions, and described non-existent insignia corresponding to FPLC ranks and events which,
by simple mathematical calculation, are impossible.“ (para. 8, ICC-01/04-01/06-759-Conf-tEN).
Similarly, in relation to Kristine Peduto, the Chamber holds the view that the examples given at pages
14 to 29 of document ICC-01/04-01/06-759-Conf-tEN by the Defence, pertaining to “serious
ICC-01/04-01/06-803-tEN 14-05-2007 43/157 SL PT
No. 01/04-01/06 44/157 29 January 2007
Official Court Translation
120. Furthermore, the Chamber recalls that in a previous decision, it held that “in
application of article 69(4) of the Statute, “the Chamber may rule on the relevance or
admissibility of any evidence, taking into account, inter alia, the probative value of
the evidence and any prejudice that such evidence may cause to a fair trial or to a fair
evaluation of the testimony of a witness, in accordance with the Rules of Evidence and
Procedure.”
125
121. In exercising its discretion and in accordance with the jurisprudence of the
ICTR,
126 the Chamber declares that it will attach a higher probative value to those
parts of the children’s and Kristine Peduto’s evidence which have been corroborated,
as is apparent from several sections of this decision.
122. However, the Chamber wishes to emphasise that, according to the
jurisprudence of the ICTY, less probative value is not necessarily attached to parts of
a witness statement that have not been specifically corroborated, and which do not
vary from the statement as a whole.127

contradictions, chronic uncertainty, severe memory lapses, serious mistakes, as well as an alarming
lack of knowledge of her working environment and the general background in Ituri“, do not
necessarily affect the truthfulness of her testimony as a whole.
125 See ICC-01/04-01/06-690.
126 In The Prosecutor v. Clément Kayishema and Obed Ruzindana, Case No. ICTR-95-1, Trial Judgement,
21 May 1999, it is stated at para. 80 that “[d]oubts about a testimony can be removed with the
corroboration of other testimonies. However, corroboration of evidence is not a legal requirement to
accept a testimony.“
127 See The Prosecutor v. Delalić et al., Case No. IT-96-21, Trial Judgement, 16 November 1998, paras. 594-
597: “As a general principle, the Trial Chamber has attached probative value to the testimony of each
witness and exhibit according to its relevance and credibility. The Trial Chamber notes that, pursuant
to Rule 89 of the Rules, it is not bound by any national rules of evidence and as such, has been guided
by the foregoing principles with a view to a fair determination of the issues before it. In particular, the
Trial Chamber notes the finding in the Tadić Judgment that corroboration of evidence is not a
customary rule of international law, and as such should not be ordinarily required by the International
Tribunal. […] The Trial Chamber has considered the oral testimony before it in the light of these
considerations. Accordingly, inconsistencies or inaccuracies between the prior statements and oral
testimony of a witness, or between different witnesses, are relevant factors in judging weight but need
not be, of themselves, a basis to find the whole of a witness’ testimony unreliable. The Trial Chamber
has attached probative value to testimony primarily on the basis of the oral testimony given in the
courtroom, as opposed to prior statements, where the demeanour of the relevant witnesses could be
observed first hand by the Trial Chamber and placed in the context of all the other evidence before it.“

vii) Items not included in the Prosecution List of Evidence
123. The Defence objects to the admission of four reports presented by the
Prosecution at the hearing of 27 November 2006 on the meaning of the term “hema
gegere.“
128
124. It also objects to the admission of an expert report presented before the Cour
d‘appel de Paris and introduced by the Prosecution at the hearing of 27 November
2006. Amongst other things, the report concerns the place where an e-mail account
was created and from which were sent five messages introduced into evidence by the
Defence.129
125. Although the above-mentioned reports were tendered by the Prosecution after
the expiration of the time limit prescribed by rule 121(5) of the Rules, the Chamber
considers that it is empowered, under articles 69(3) and (4) of the Statute, to admit
evidence presented out of the said time limit, if: i) such evidence is necessary to rule
on the merits of the issues considered at the confirmation hearing; ii) the Prosecution
could not have foreseen the need to present the said evidence nor could it have
presented it within the time limit prescribed by rule 121(5) of the Rules; and iii) the
Defence had the opportunity to challenge the additional evidence presented. In this
case, the Chamber finds that these three conditions have been satisfied, and therefore
decides to admit the said reports into evidence.
viii) The probative value of some of the evidence disclosed to the
Defence
126. At the confirmation hearing, the Defence raised certain objections to the
admissibility and probative value of the witness statements included in the
Prosecution List of Evidence and disclosed to the Defence in unredacted form.

127. First, the Defence points out that nowhere in these statements taken by an
OTP investigator is it mentioned that the witness took an oath. The Defence submits
that before the international tribunals, a representative of the Registry is present
when a deposition is taken.131 The ICTY practice to which the Defence refers and, in
particular, rule 92bis of its Rules of Procedure and Evidence (on the admission of written
statements and transcripts in lieu of oral testimony), applies to the trial phase.
Accordingly, the Chamber finds that it is not applicable in the context of a
confirmation hearing.
128. Secondly, the Defence argues that the mere presentation of a statement or
written deposition does not entitle the opposing party to conduct a crossexamination, thus diminishing the probative value of the testimony.
132 In this regard,
the Chamber recalls that under article 61(5) of the Statute, the Prosecution “may rely
on documentary or summary evidence and need not call the witnesses expected to
testify at the trial.” Moreover, there is nothing in the Statute and the Rules to indicate
that statements, transcripts of interviews or summaries of evidence must be
considered as having a lower probative value.
129. Finally, the Defence submits that the probative value of the evidence for which
the Chamber authorised redactions is seriously diminished.133 In this respect, the
Chamber refers to its Second Decision on the Prosecution Requests and Amended Requests
for Redactions under Rule 81, as quoted in the section on anonymous hearsay evidence.
130. Accordingly, the Chamber dismisses the Defence objections concerning the
admissibility and probative value of some of the witness statements disclosed to it.

b. Issues raised by the Prosecution
i) Items included in the Defence List of Evidence filed on 2
November 2006
131. At the hearing of 27 November 2006, the Prosecution objected to certain pieces
of evidence presented by the Defence at the confirmation hearing and numbered as
follows: EVD-D01-00001, EVD-D01-00002, EVD-D01-00003, EVD-D01-00004, EVDD01-00005 and EVD-D01-00006. The Defence stated that they are paper copies of emails sent by [REDACTED] between 19 July 2002 and 5 August 2002. The
Prosecution disputes the authenticity of these e-mails and asks that the Chamber
attach no probative value to them.134
132. The Chamber notes that the Prosecution does not object to the admissibility of
these items for the purpose of the confirmation hearing, but only to their probative
value. Consequently, the Chamber will determine their probative value on a case-bycase basis, if necessary.
ii) Items not included in the List of Evidence filed by the
Defence on 2 November 2006
133. The Prosecution objects to the admission of the signed and dated version of
[REDACTED]’s letter presented by the Defence on 27 November 2006.135
134. In addition, the Defence based its allegations concerning the probative value
of child testimony on a study by the University of California, Berkley, entitled Child
Witnesses at the Special Court for Sierra Leone. At the hearing of 22 November 2006,136
the Chamber asked the Defence to provide the study, if it felt it was useful. The
Defence then referred to it in its closing submissions.137
135. Although the above-mentioned reports and documents were tendered by the
Defence after the expiration of the time limit prescribed by rule 121(6) of the Rules,

the Chamber considers that it is empowered, under articles 69(3) and (4) of the
Statute, to admit evidence presented by the Defence out of the said time limit, if: i)
such evidence is necessary to rule on the merits of the issues considered at the
confirmation hearing; ii) the Defence could not have foreseen the need to present the
said evidence nor could it have presented it within the time limit prescribed by rule
121(6) of the Rules; and iii) the Prosecution had the opportunity to challenge the
evidence so presented. In this case, the Chamber finds that these three conditions are
satisfied in relation to [REDACTED]’s letter, and therefore decides to admit it.
136. Regarding the study by the University of California, Berkley, although the
Defence offered to introduce it into the record of the case, it has yet to provide a copy
thereof to the Chamber or the Prosecution. The Chamber therefore declares the study
inadmissible for the purpose of the confirmation hearing.
iii) Issues relating to the Defence request to withdraw two
statements from its List of Evidence
137. In its List of Additional Evidence filed on 7 November 2006, the Defence
included statements and the transcript of the interviews of [REDACTED], statements
on which it intended to rely at the confirmation hearing (“the Statements“).138
138. On 24 November 2006, the Defence filed a “Defence notification of withdrawal
of evidence”, seeking leave from the Chamber to withdraw the Statements and
requesting that the Registry be ordered to remove them from the eCourt system.139
139. On 27 November 2006, the Prosecution orally objected to the “Defence
notification of withdrawal of evidence” arguing, inter alia, that only the Chamber had
the prerogative to decide whether or not to use material introduced into evidence to

ascertain the truth, regardless of whether the party who submitted it wants it to be
withdrawn.140
140. First, the Chamber notes that nothing in the Statute or the Rules empowers
parties to withdraw evidence included in their List of Evidence.
141. The Chamber is of the view that items and documents included in the
Prosecution and the Defence Lists of Evidence and Lists of Additional Evidence cease
to be separate pieces of evidence presented by the parties and become evidence on
the record, which the Chamber may use to determine, pursuant to article 61(7) of the
Statute, whether there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to
believe that the person committed each of the crimes which he or she is alleged to
have committed.
142. In this respect, the Chamber considers that such a determination would be
undermined if parties were able to withdraw evidence initially included in their List
of Evidence, but which no longer met their expectations in light of the unfolding
confirmation hearing.
143. The Chamber’s position is consistent with its previous decisions on this
matter, for instance, its Decision on the Practices of Witness Familiarisation and Witness
Proofing, where it noted that “... witnesses to a crime are the property neither of the
Prosecution nor of the Defence and […] should therefore not be considered as
witnesses of either party, but as witnesses of the Court.“
141
144. The Chamber also bears in mind that the Prosecution had already sought to
rely on the two statements concerned,142 but that the Chamber had disallowed their
inclusion in the Prosecution List of Evidence, in light of the Chamber’s duty to
protect witnesses under article 68 of the Rome Statute.143 The Chamber recognises

that the protective measures in respect of the Statements became pointless when the
Defence gained access to the Statements and added them to its List of Evidence.
145. Accordingly, the Chamber dismisses the Defence request to withdraw the
Statements.

III. PROCEDURAL MATTERS
A. Defence application regarding the form of the Document Containing
the Charges
146. With regard to the document containing the charges and the list of evidence,
rule 121(3) of the Rules states that:
The Prosecutor shall provide to the Pre-Trial Chamber and the person, no later
than 30 days before the date of the confirmation hearing, a detailed description of
the charges together with a list of the evidence which he or she intends to present
at the hearing.
147. Regulation 52 of the Regulations of the Court states that the document
containing the charges referred to in article 61 shall include:
(a) The full name of the person and any other relevant identifying information;
(b) A statement of the facts, including the time and place of the alleged crimes,
which provides a sufficient legal and factual basis to bring the person or persons to
trial, including relevant facts for the exercise of jurisdiction by the Court;
(c) A legal characterisation of the facts to accord both with the crimes under articles
6, 7 or 8 and the precise form of participation under articles 25 and 28.
148. In an application dated 16 October 2006144 and at the confirmation hearing, the
Defence criticised the form of the Document Containing the Charges transmitted by
the Prosecution. According to the Defence:
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo has a right to be promptly informed of the nature and
cause of the charge. The nature of the charge refers to the precise legal qualification
of the offence, and the cause of the charge refers to the facts underlying it. In terms
of the cause of the charge, the Prosecution must plead all material facts which, to
the extent possible, should include the identity of the victims, the place and
approximate date of the acts and the means by which the offences were
committed.145
149. The various criticisms levelled at the Prosecution’s Document Containing the
Charges may be summarised as follows: i) factual or legal vagueness of certain
paragraphs; and ii) articulation of useless facts for the purpose of buttressing the
charges brought against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo.

144 ICC-01/04-01/06-573

No. 01/04-01/06 52/157 29 January 2007
Official Court Translation
150. On the one hand, regarding the factual vagueness alleged by the Defence, the
Chamber considers that the Document Containing the Charges submitted by the
Prosecution meets the criteria set forth in regulation 52 of the Regulations of the Court
and is indeed a “detailed” description of the charges against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo.
In addition, the Chamber recalls that the Document Containing the Charges
transmitted by the Prosecution is to be read in conjunction with the Prosecution List
of Evidence. Thus, there is evidence relating to each paragraph of the Document
Containing the Charges. Nevertheless, the Chamber notes that, for the proper
administration of justice, it would sometimes have been advisable to provide greater
specificity in the Prosecution List of Evidence.
151. On the other hand, the Defence takes issue with the Prosecution for not
sufficiently articulating the points of law underpinning certain parts of its Document
Containing the Charges. However, the Prosecution is under no obligation to
articulate in the Document Containing the Charges its legal understanding of the
various modes of liability and the alleged crimes. That the Prosecution was not
inclined to overly articulate this point in the Document Containing the Charges is not
prejudicial to the rights of the Defence, since the various crimes charged and the
mode of liability contemplated are clearly articulated.
146
152. Lastly, the Defence takes issue with the Prosecution for having included facts
in the Document Containing the Charges which, as noted by the Defence, would not
be relevant in the context of the confirmation or otherwise of the charges against
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo and should therefore not have been included therein.147 The
Chamber holds the view that nothing prevents the Prosecution from mentioning any
event which occurred before or during the commission of the acts or omission with

146 See paragraphs 20-24 of the Document Containing the Charges.
147 See, for example, the Defence challenge to paragraph 26 of the Document Containing the Charges,
which states that “[p]rior to the foundation of the FPLC, and since 2001 at the latest, the UPC actively

which the suspect is charged, especially if that would be helpful in better
understanding the context in which the conduct charged occurred.
153. On this last point, the Chamber can only regret that the Prosecution did not
see fit to plead with greater specificity the context in which the crimes with which
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo is charged occurred.
B. Matters relating to the disclosure process for potentially exculpatory
evidence or evidence which could be material to the preparation of the
Defence
154. The Defence alleges that the Prosecution did not disclose to it all exculpatory
evidence or evidence material to its preparation. The Chamber recalls that, prior to
the confirmation hearing, the Prosecution‘s obligation was solely to disclose to the
Defence the bulk of potentially exculpatory evidence or evidence which could be
material to the preparation of the Defence.
148 The Chamber held many status
conferences to ensure that the disclosure process between the Prosecution and the
Defence was properly conducted, and notes that the Prosecution repeatedly stated
that it had fulfilled its obligations and had effectively disclosed to the Defence the
bulk of potentially exculpatory evidence or evidence which could be material to the
preparation of the Defence.
149 Moreover, nothing has been presented to contradict
these submissions.

148 In this regard, see Decision ICC-01/04-01/06-102 or ICC-01/04-01/06-581-Conf-tEN.
149 See, for example, the first day of the confirmation hearing: ICC-01/04-0/06-T-30-
EN[9Nov2006Edited], p. 146, lines 4-13: “There are disclosure obligations of the Office of the
Prosecutor under article 67(2), potentially exculpatory material. There are disclosure obligations
pursuant to article 61(3)(b), incriminatory evidence for the purpose of the confirmation hearing and
there’s an obligation under rule 77 to provide for inspection of certain materials and the Office of the
Prosecutor has fulfilled its disclosure obligations very much in line with respect to the order of the
Single Judge. The Office of the Prosecutor went beyond its legal duties.“ or ICC-01/04-0/06-T-17-ConfEN[5sept2006Edited], p. 40, lines 9-11. Regarding the disclosure process for materials which are
potentially exculpatory or otherwise necessary for the preparation of the defence, see, for example,
ICC-01/04-01/06-T-13-Conf-EN[24August2006Edited], p. 29, line 17 to p. 30, line 15, and the two
annexes of document ICC-01/04-01/06-611-Conf filed by the Prosecution on 25 October 2006.

C. Defence request to exclude certain parts of the Prosecution’s final
observations
155. In a request filed on 4 December 2006,150 the Defence asked the Chamber to
order the Prosecution to re-file its written submissions after striking out certain
paragraphs. According to the Defence, the Prosecution could not address the matters
dealt with in those passages.
156. In this regard, the Chamber will limit itself to recalling its two previous
decisions on the subject151 and to stating that it will consider only issues that were
discussed orally by the parties at the confirmation hearing.
D. Defence request for access to a report registered in the record of the
Situation
157. On 18 December 2006, the Defence filed an urgent request seeking access to a
report by the NGOs Human Rights Watch and Redress that was registered in the
record of the Situation in the DRC on 30 June 2005.152 The Defence stated that it
required the report in order to respond to the document entitled “Submissions by
Victims a/0001/06, a/0002/06 and a/0003/06 further to the Appeals Chamber’s
Decision of 12 December 2006.”
153 The Defence had until 20 December 2006 to
respond to those submissions.
158. While it did not object to the request, the Prosecution nevertheless requested
that the Chamber seek the views of the above-mentioned NGOs prior to deciding
whether to disclose their report to the Defence.154
159. The Chamber notes that the report was referred to in paragraph 101 of the
Decision on the Prosecution’s Application for a Warrant of Arrest, Article 58, rendered on

150 ICC-01/04-01/06-752
151 ICC-01/04-01/06-678 and ICC-01/04-01/06-743-tEN
152 ICC-01/04-01/06-779-Conf.
153 The Defence indicated that the document was numbered ICC-01/04-01/06-776-Conf-tEN. Since the
document was filed as confidential in proceedings before the Appeals Chamber, it should be noted
that the Chamber has access only to the public redacted version numbered ICC-01/04-01/06-778-tEN.

20 February 2006,155 and that reference is made to the same paragraph in the Decision
on the Application for the interim release of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, rendered on 18
October 2006.156 The urgent nature of the request filed by the Defence on
18 December 2006 seeking to obtain the document prior to 20 December 2006 is
therefore unwarranted.
160. The Chamber also recalls that in order to have access to a non-public
document in the record of the Situation in the DRC, the Defence must: i) identify the
specific document and ii) provide the reasons for requesting access to it.157
161. Without specifying that the victims had cited the report in their submissions,
the Defence merely explained that the victims were alleging that certain threats had
been made against the witnesses, but gave no details whatsoever about the substance
of those allegations.
162. In the Chamber’s opinion, the Defence has accordingly failed to sufficiently
explain why that particular document would have enabled it to address the
allegations made by the victims in their submissions before the Appeals Chamber.
163. The Chamber therefore rejects the urgent request filed by the Defence on
18 December 2006.
E. Jurisdiction of the Court and admissibility of the case of The Prosecutor
v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo
164. Article 19(1) of the Statute provides that:
The Court shall satisfy itself that it has jurisdiction in any case brought before it.
The Court may, on its own motion, determine the admissibility of a case in
accordance with article 17.
165. The Chamber recalls that in its decisions of 10 February 2006 and 3 October
2006, it ruled that the instant case fell within the jurisdiction of the Court. It further

recalls that in the decision of 10 February 2006, it ruled that the instant case was
admissible pursuant to article 17 of the Statute.
166. The Chamber notes that in its Document Containing the Charges the
Prosecution did not alter the temporal, geographic, material and personal
jurisdictional criteria articulated in the warrant of arrest issued against Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo. In addition, nothing new has been submitted to the Chamber in
respect of jurisdiction and admissibility in the instant case.

IV. MATERIAL ELEMENTS OF THE CRIME
A. Existence and nature of the armed conflict in Ituri
1. Analysis of the evidence relating to the existence and nature of the armed
conflict
a. From September 2000 to late August 2002
167. [REDACTED] since early 2003) and [REDACTED] stated that the UPC was
created as a result of the July 2000 mutiny of Hema officers and soldiers in the Armée
du Peuple Congolais [the military wing of the Rassemblement Congolais pour la
Démocratie/Kisangani (RCD/K) led by Wamba dia Wamba, the then Governor of
Ituri].158 According to both of them as well as [REDACTED],
159 Thomas Lubanga
Dyilo, Chief Kahwa Panga Mandro, Floribert Kisembo, Bosco Ntaganda and
Tchaligonza all participated in the mutiny in one way or another.160
168. [REDACTED] explains that the UPC was created in complete secrecy on 15
September 2000 at Richard Lonema’s home in order to counter the RCD/K-ML
(Rassemblement congolais pour la démocratie/Kisangani-Mouvement de libération161) and
that it was to receive military support from the July 2000 Hema mutineers.162
According to [REDACTED], Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, who had been appointed UPC
spokesman by reason of his political experience and contacts, was tasked with
explaining the UPC’s goals to the Ugandan authorities. However, once the leadership
of the RCD/K became aware, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was placed under house arrest
in Uganda sometime in late 2000.163

169. According to [REDACTED]164 and [REDACTED],
165 while Thomas Lubanga
Dyilo was detained in Uganda, the conflict between Wamba dia Wamba (President of
the RCD/K) and his two deputies, Mbusa Nyambisi and John Tibasima, escalated and
[REDACTED] had to flee from Bunia and take refuge in [REDACTED]. The Ugandan
authorities then encouraged the creation of a platform called Front pour la Liberation
du Congo (FLC), presided over by Jean-Pierre Bemba and bringing together JeanPierre Bemba’s Mouvement pour la Liberation du Congo (MLC), Mbusa Nyambisi’s
RCD-K/ML and Roger Lumbala’s RCD/National.166
170. [REDACTED] points out that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo did not officially
announce the creation of the UPC until 9 January 2001, after the founding of the FLC
which, under the auspices of the Ugandan authorities, brought together Jean Pierre
Bemba’s MLC and Mbusa Nyamwisi’s RCD-K/ML.167 In their statements,
[REDACTED]168 and [REDACTED]169 also refer to the creation of the FLC and the
appointment of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo as Vice-Minister of Youth and Sports in the
FLC Government in Ituri, which lasted only a few months.
171. According to [REDACTED],
170 [REDACTED],
171 [REDACTED]172 and
[REDACTED],
173 the mutiny ended when the insurgent officers were sent to the
military training camp in Jinja (in Uganda) and the rest of the mutineers to the
Kyakwanzi camp (also in Uganda). At the end of their military training, the
mutineers formed the core of the Simba Battalion, which was deployed to the
Équatoriale Province as part of the military wing of the FLC.174

172. According to [REDACTED],
175 [REDACTED]176 and [REDACTED],
177 after the
break-up of the FLC, its member parties regained their autonomy and, as early as
November 2001 at least, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was appointed Defence Minister of
the RCD-K/ML Government in Ituri.
173. [REDACTED] explains how, after the break-up of the FLC in 2001, the Hema
mutineers – around 350 men under the command of Floribert Kisembo – were
redeployed to Bunia as part of the APC.178 On their return to Bunia, problems arose
between the Hema mutineers and the APC’s Nande officers – problems which
eventually led to the murder of Claude Kiza, APC Chief of Staff, in April 2002.
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, at the time Defence Minister, backed the Hema mutineers.179
174. According to [REDACTED]180 and [REDACTED],
181 these events led to a
confrontation between Thomas Lubanga Dyilo and Mbusa Nyamwisi (President of
the RCD/K-ML) and, subsequently, to a declaration on 17 April 2002 by which the
UPC broke with the RCD/K-ML and effectively became a political-military
movement. As explained by [REDACTED]:
On 17 April 2002, the UPC’s political inner circle issued an official statement
announcing the effective transformation of the UPC into a political/military
movement. […]The statement of 17 April 2002 was signed by the UPC’s senior
political officials, i.e. [REDACTED], LUBANGA and ten or so other people. […] At
the time of its official formation on 17 April 2002, the UPC’s army had men,
weapons and ammunition at its disposal. LUBANGA was then the RCD-K/ML’s
minister for defence and the UPC’s soldiers all came from the APC. When they
joined the UPC, they brought with them their guns and ammunition. At that point,
our primary objective was to oust the RCD-K/ML.182

175. [REDACTED]183 and [REDACTED]184 describe the two meetings held in
Uganda in April 2002 (Kasese) and June 2002 (Kampala) at the request of the
Ugandan authorities and attended by a UPC delegation headed by Thomas Lubanga
Dyilo and an RCD/K-ML delegation. According to both of them185 as well as
[REDACTED],
186 after the second meeting, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo and other
members of the UPC delegation were arrested by the Ugandan authorities and sent
to Kinshasa, where they were detained, first at the DEMIAP until August 2002, and
subsequently at the Kinshasa Grand Hotel and the Hotel Lolo la Crevette.187
176. In [REDACTED] statement, [REDACTED] describes the military assistance
(arms, ammunition and uniforms) received by the UPC from Rwanda via Chief
Kahwa in June and July 2002.188 With the recruits trained at the Mandro training
camp, amongst others, by military instructors sent from Rwanda,
189 the UPC was able
to attack the APC in Bunia. In this regard, [REDACTED] Bosco Ntaganda and Chief
Kahwa concerning the receipt of arms and ammunition from Rwanda at the time.190
In addition, regarding [REDACTED] stay [REDACTED] says that:
As far as the military training was concerned, BOSCO was assisted by somebody
called SAFARI who was a Rwandan soldier who came to visit the camp fairly
often. I can remember the following military leaders being present in MANDRO:
KYALIGONZA, KASANGAKI, KISEMBO, LOBHO Désiré, BAGONZA and
Rwandans such as BESTO “BEBE”, RAFIKI, MUGABO, Ali MBUYI and TIGER
ONE. All these people would later have important positions within the UPC army
when it seized control of BUNIA.

result of which the UPC took control of Bunia.194 According to [REDACTED], the
UPDF attacked the APC in Bunia because the APC had invited members of the Forces
Armées Congolaises, including a certain Colonel Aguru, to Ituri.195 [REDACTED] also
mentions the UPDF attack in early August 2002 on the residence of Jean-Pierre
Molondo Lopondo, RCD-K/ML Governor in Ituri, and the withdrawal of APC troops
from Bunia.196
178. According to [REDACTED], at the time the UPDF and the UPC attacked Bunia
– in early August 2002 – Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, although held in detention in Bunia,
(i) was in direct contact with the UPC political and military leadership in Bunia,
including Richard Lonema, Daniel Litscha and Floribert Kisembo, and (ii) approved
their actions and encouraged them to continue.197 Additionally, at the same time,
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was preparing the Déclaration Politique du Front pour la
Réconciliation et la Paix, which was signed by all UPC members detained in Kinshasa
at the time, and in which the Front pour la Réconciliation et la Paix (the name intended
to replace “UPC”) claimed to control of Bunia.198
179. However, [REDACTED] states that, while at the DEMIAP (Détection militaire
des activités anti-patrie), Thomas Lubanga Dyilo and the other detainees [REDACTED]
did not have the right to receive visits or to communicate with the outside world.199
Also, [REDACTED] of the Déclaration Politique du Front pour la Réconciliation et la Paix,

informed that “UPC forces were taking up position behind the UPDF’s positions.“ (DRC-OTP-0066-

195 DRC-OTP-0066-0020, para. 92. Correspondence between the [REDACTED] addresses [REDACTED]

200 [REDACTED] also explains that Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo signed the declaration in his capacity as “coordinator” – and not as
“president” – of the Front pour la Réconciliation et la Paix because “[REDACTED] ask
him to sign it as the president because [REDACTED] needed the agreement of our

180. [REDACTED]202 and [REDACTED]203 explain how Thomas Lubanga Dyilo and
the other UPC members detained in Kinshasa were freed at the end of August 2002 in
exchange for the Congolese Minister Ntumba Luaba, who had been taken hostage in
Bunia by Chief Kahwa and whose release the Ugandan authorities immediately
undertook negotiations to secure.
b. From September 2002 to June 2003
181. [REDACTED] states that, upon their return to Bunia, they went to the Mandro
Camp, where they agreed (i) to replace the name UPC with Union des Patriotes
Congolais/Réconciliation et Paix (UPC/RP); (ii) to unanimously appoint Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo President of the movement; and (iii) to designate the members of the
first UPC/RP executive.204 [REDACTED] adds that:
Before the members of the executive were appointed, a consensus was reached that
Thomas LUBANGA be appointed president of the movement. Although this move
was not wholly consistent with our movement’s constitution – in that an election
ought really to have been held – everyone agreed that he be appointed.205
182. [REDACTED] also states that the first decree of the new UPC/RP executive in
early September 2002 was prepared by Thomas Lubanga Dyilo “in conjunction with

the military people“ and that it dealt with the creation of the FPLC as the military
wing of the UPC/RP.206 He states that:
the only persons in the executive that could have had a direct relationship with the
FPLC soldiers were President Thomas LUBANGA and Chief KAHWA PANGA
MANDRO, the deputy national secretary for defence. I am aware that the president
was kept extremely busy by his political activities and so left it to KAHWA to
manage the military side of things.
183. According to the testimonies of [REDACTED], as well as MONUC and
Human Rights Watch (HRW) reports, there were several military operations
allegedly involving the FPLC in Ituri between September 2002 and late 2002. The
operations included the alleged attack by the APC and Ngiti fighters on Nyankunde
in September 2002,207 the alleged UPC attack on Mongbwalu in November 2002,208
and the alleged UPC attack on Kilo in December 2002.209
184. [REDACTED] states that the UPC/RP executive was reshuffled on 11
December 2002; changes brought about included the elimination of the position of
Deputy National Secretary for Defence (until then held by Chief Kahwa Panga
Mandro) so that defence matters came within the remit of the Office of the President,

Mandro from the FPLC in early December 2002.212 According to [REDACTED],
213
[REDACTED], and [REDACTED],
214 Chief Kahwa then proceeded to establish PUSIC
before the end of 2002. [REDACTED] states that a number of FPLC members joined
PUSIC which, according to the testimony of Kristine Peduto, was said to be in control
of the Mandro sector.215 Regarding the founding of PUSIC, [REDACTED] points out
that:
That is how come KAHWA went to talk with KABILA in December 2002 about
establishing a new Hema group to destabilise and weaken the UPC. KABILA gave
him US$250,000 to start up his new party. With the money, KABILA wanted to
create a coalition that could bring together the Alurs, Hemas and Lendus in order
to destabilise LUBANGA.216
186. According to [REDACTED], General Jérôme was the FPLC commander of the
North-East Sector in the final months of 2002,217 until he proclaimed his
independence from the UPC/RP and FPLC in January 2003.218 He then founded the
Forces Armées du Peuple Congolais (FAPC), which a number of FPLC members joined
and which controlled the Aru Mahagi sector.219 According to [REDACTED], both the
FAPC and PUSIC were founded with the backing of the Ugandan authorities.

187. [REDACTED] states that other political-military movements were established
in December 2002 or January 2003, including the Front National Intégrationniste (FNI)
and the Forces Populaires pour la Démocratie au Congo (FPDC).221 According to
[REDACTED]:
The movements had been officially set up while [REDACTED]. The movements

names of the other movements’ leaders [REDACTED] in order to found what was
to be the FIPI.222
188. [REDACTED] adds that in late January/early February 2003, PUSIC, the FNI
and the FPDC founded the Front pour l’Intégration et la Paix en Ituri (FIPI).223 The
following day, the Ugandan President, Yoweri Museveni, received the presidents of
PUSIC (Chief Kahwa), the FNI (Floribert Nbagu) and the FPDC (Thomas Unencan).224
A few days later, they were also received by DRC President Joseph Kabila first, in
Dar es Salaam, then in Kinshasa.225 According to [REDACTED]:
Despite the good intentions behind the creation of the FIPI, the movement did not
last very long. As I have already explained, the FIPI was created because that was
what Presidents MUSEVENI and KABILA wanted. Its creation was meant not only
to try and force LUBANGA’s hand into taking part in the IPC but also to divide the
Hema community by pitting the Northern and Southern Hemas against one
another. One of the reasons that the coalition did not survive for very long was the
fact that the groups making up the coalition failed to agree on appointing a single
president and two vice-presidents.226

189. [REDACTED] two sets of reasons why Uganda which, until then, had been
supplying the UPC/RP and the FPLC with arms after training them and working
closely with them,227 changed its approach and ended up chosing to attack the FPLC
forces in Bunia on 6 March 2003 along with the FNI:
a. from August 2002 to March 2003, Floribert Kisembo attempted to organise
the Congolese, but the area was under total Ugandan control,
228 and
problems with Uganda surfaced when he attempted to reorganise the
army;229
b. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo had created an alliance with the Rassemblement
Congolais pour la Democratie – Goma230 which, according to the UN report,
had very close ties with Rwanda.231
190. On this point, [REDACTED] stresses that relations between the UPC and
Rwanda came to the fore again starting in late 2002.232 Again, according to
[REDACTED]233 and as mentioned by [REDACTED] in [REDACTED] statement,234
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was particularly close to Rafiki Saba and Bosco Ntaganda,
who were Rwandan-speaking Tutsis from North Kivu. [REDACTED] also states that
“Kisembo confirmed [REDACTED] that Bosco [Ntaganda] received his orders as
much from Kigali as from Lubanga,”
235 and maintains that:
LUBANGA apparently had absolute power within the UPC, but it was not
necessarily he who made all the decisions. From [REDACTED] with former
members and senior officials of the UPC, [REDACTED] that some of the UPC
policy and strategy decisions were made with the agreement of the Rwandan

237 [REDACTED],
238 Kristine Peduto239 and
MONUC,240 fighting between the UPC and the UPDF forces, which were backed by
the FNI, reportedly caused the UPC to pull out of the town of Bunia on 6 March 2003.
192. [REDACTED] explains [REDACTED] from Bunia on 6 March 2003 “because
we were chased by the Ugandans.”
241 Speaking of what happened after the joint
UPDF-FNI attack on the UPC/RP and the FPLC in Bunia on 6 March 2003 he states:
“[…] [REDACTED] scattered … […] [REDACTED] left with some soldiers and went
into the bush [REDACTED] safety […] [REDACTED] 12 May 2003 […]”.
242 Thus,
when Kristine Peduto visited the Rwampara military training camp in mid-March
2003, she was accompanied by General Kale, who was a member of the UPDF, and
his second-in-command, Commander Felix.

of an Ituri Pacification Commission (IPC). According to [REDACTED], who

Peace commissions had been set up in lots of villages in Ituri, and particularly in
Djugu territory, either in order to prevent likely attacks or as a result of attacks and
acts of violence that had occurred in the area. I would say, though, that the peace
commissions were more like war commissions, because they also oversaw the local
defence militias that had set up in the villages.248

in Bunia, notably with the task of guaranteeing a presence at the Bunia airfield and
protecting United Nations personnel and facilities, and IPC meeting places in
Bunia.259 On 30 May 2003, the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution

accordance with the mandate under Security Council resolution 1484 (2003).
Operation ARTEMIS began on 12 June 2003 under a French commander, General
Neveux.260 According to MONUC’s Secretary-General’s fourteenth report, the armed

2. The characterisation of the armed conflict
200. In his Document Containing the Charges, the Prosecutor considers that the
alleged crimes were committed in the context of a conflict not of an international
character.273 The Defence contends however that consideration should be given to the
fact that during the relevant period, the Ituri region was under the control of Uganda,
Rwanda or MONUC. In the view of the Defence, the involvement of foreign
elements, such as the UPDF, could internationalise the armed conflict in Ituri.274
Furthermore, in her closing statement at the confirmation hearing, the Representative
of Victim a/0105/06 asserted that the involvement of Uganda and Rwanda in the
Congolese conflict, including in Ituri, was a matter of common knowledge. She
added, however, that the characterisation of the armed conflict had to be done on a
case-by-case basis. In her opinion, regardless of the type of armed conflict, the Statute
offers exactly the same protection, adding that the UPC had set up a quasi-state
structure which could be described as a “national armed force”.
275
201. According to articles 8(2)(b)(xxvi) and 8(2)(e)(vii) of the Statute and the
Elements of the Crimes in question, conscripting or enlisting children under the age
of fifteen years and using them to participate actively in hostilities entails criminal
responsibility, if
[t]he conduct took place in the context of and was associated with an international
armed conflict; or the conduct took place in the context of and was associated with
an armed conflict not of an international character.
202. Under article 61(7)(c)(ii) of the Statute, the Chamber is required to adjourn the
hearing and request the Prosecutor to consider amending the charges if it finds that

person for trial for crimes which would be materially different from those set out in
the Document Containing the Charges and for which the Defence would not have
had the opportunity to submit observations at the confirmation hearing.
204. In this case, the Chamber concurs with the Representative of Victim a/105/06,
that the protection afforded by the Statute against enlisting, conscripting and active
participation in hostilities of children under the age of fifteen years is similar in
scope, regardless of the characterisation of the armed conflict. Thus, as will be
discussed below, articles 8(2)(b)(xxvi) and 8(2)(e)(vii) of the Statute criminalise the
same conduct, whether it is committed in the context of a conflict of an international
character or in the context of a conflict not of an international character.
Consequently, the Chamber considers that it is not necessary to adjourn the hearing
and request the Prosecutor to amend the charges.
a. From July 2002 to June 2003: Existence of an armed conflict of
an international character
205. The Chamber observes that neither the Statute nor the Elements of Crimes
provide a definition of an international armed conflict for the purposes of article
8(2)(b). Only footnote 34 of the Elements of Crimes states that the term “international
armed conflict” includes military occupation. Accordingly, the Chamber finds that,
pursuant to article 21(1)(b) of the Statute, and with due regard to article 21(3) of the
Statute, it is useful to rely on the applicable treaties and the principles and rules of
international law, including the established principles of the international law of
armed conflict.
206. Common Article 2 of the Geneva Conventions, which is applicable to
international armed conflicts, provides that:
ICC-01/04-01/06-803-tEN 14-05-2007 72/157 SL PT
No. 01/04-01/06 73/157 29 January 2007
Official Court Translation
In addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peace time, the present
Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict
which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the
state of war is not recognized by one of them. The Convention shall also apply to
all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party,
even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance.
207. The Commentary on the Geneva Conventions states that any difference
arising between two States and leading to the intervention of members of the armed
forces is an armed conflict within the meaning of Article 2, even if one of the Parties
denies the existence of a state of war. It makes no difference how long the conflict
lasts, or how much slaughter takes place. The respect due to human personality is not
measured by the number of victims.276
208. In addition, the Chamber observes that the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY
adopts the same interpretation of the expression “international armed conflict”.
277
209. The Chamber considers an armed conflict to be international in character if it
takes place between two or more States; this extends to the partial or total occupation
of the territory of another State, whether or not the said occupation meets with armed
resistance. In addition, an internal armed conflict that breaks out on the territory of a
State may become international – or, depending upon the circumstances, be
international in character alongside an internal armed conflict – if (i) another State
intervenes in that conflict through its troops (direct intervention), or if (ii) some of the
participants in the internal armed conflict act on behalf of that other State (indirect
intervention).
278
210. Regarding the second alternative, the ICTY Appeals Chamber has specified
the circumstances under which armed forces can be considered to be acting on behalf
of a foreign State, thus lending the armed conflict an international character. In Tadić,
the Appeals Chamber set out the constituent elements of the “overall control”
exercised by a foreign State on such armed forces:

Official Court Translation
[C]ontrol by a State over subordinate armed forces or militias or paramilitary units may
be of an overall character (and must comprise more than the mere provision of
financial assistance or military equipment or training). […] The control required by
international law may be deemed to exist when a State […] has a role in organising,
co-ordinating or planning the military actions of the military group, in addition to
financing, training and equipping or providing operational support to that
group.279
211. The Chamber holds the view that where a State does not intervene directly on
the territory of another State through its own troops, the overall control test will be
used to determine whether armed forces are acting on behalf of the first State. The
test will be met where the first State has a role in organising, co-ordinating or
planning the military actions of the military group, in addition to financing, training
and equipping the group or providing operational support to it.
212. The Chamber notes that in the judgement rendered on 19 December 2005 in
the case of the Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda, the International Court of
Justice (ICJ) observed that, under customary international law, as reflected in Article
42 of the Hague Regulations of 1907, territory is considered to be occupied when it is
actually placed under the authority of the hostile army, and the occupation extends
only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be
exercised.280
213. In order to reach a conclusion as to whether a State, the military forces of
which are present on the territory of another State as a result of an intervention is an
occupying Power, the ICJ held that it would need to “satisfy itself that the Ugandan
armed forces in the DRC were not only stationed in particular locations but also that
they had substituted their own authority for that of the Congolese Government.”

214. In the opinion of the ICJ, the fact that General Kazini, commander of the
Ugandan forces in the DRC, appointed Adèle Lotsove as Governor of the new
province of Kibali-Ituri in June 1999 is clear evidence of the fact that Uganda
established and exercised authority in Ituri as an occupying Power.282
215. The ICJ considered “that there is also persuasive evidence that the UPDF
incited ethnic conflicts and took no action to prevent such conflicts in Ituri district.“
283
In this regard, the ICJ relied, amongst other documents, on a report by MONUC on
events in Ituri between January 2002 and December 2003 which states that “Ugandan
army commanders already present in Ituri, instead of trying to calm the situation,
preferred to benefit from the situation and support alternately one side or the other
according to their political and financial interests.”
284
216. The ICJ considered that the conduct of the UPDF as a whole is clearly
attributable to Uganda, being the conduct of a State organ, and that “the conduct of
any organ of a State must be regarded as an act of that State.”
285
217. The ICJ finds in its disposition “that the Republic of Uganda, by engaging in
military activities against the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the latter’s
territory, by occupying Ituri and by actively extending military, logistic, economic
and financial support to irregular forces having operated on the territory of the DRC,
violated the principle of non-use of force in international relations and the principle
of non-intervention”
286 and that it can be considered as an occupying Power.

218. The Chamber further notes that in his statement, [REDACTED] refers to the
[REDACTED] military training [REDACTED].
287 [REDACTED] also refers to the
taking hostage of Thomas Lubanga by Chief Kahwa and to the fact that the Ugandan
authorities immediately initiated steps to secure his release.288 Similarly, in his
statement, [REDACTED] refers to discussions with the Ugandan authorities
regarding security matters and the “organis[ation of] UPDF/UPC patrols.”
289 He
states that [REDACTED] “UPC forces were taking up position behind the UPDF’s
positions”.
290
219. In addition, the Chamber recalls that [REDACTED] states that from August
2002 to March 2003, [REDACTED] the Congolese, but that the area was under total
Ugandan control.291 Indeed, he adds that the Ugandans supplied them with arms
after training them and [REDACTED] with the Ugandans when [REDACTED].
According to him, it was [REDACTED] restructure the army of the Congolese that
problems arose with Uganda which led to the UPDF attack on Bunia on 6 March
2003.292
220. On the evidence admitted for the purpose of the confirmation hearing, the
Chamber considers that there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds
to believe that, as a result of the presence of the Republic of Uganda as an occupying
Power, the armed conflict which occurred in Ituri can be characterised as an armed
conflict of an international character from July 2002 to 2 June 2003, the date of the
effective withdrawal of the Ugandan army.
221. Similarly, some of the evidence admitted for the purpose of the confirmation
hearing bears on the role of Rwanda in the conflict in Ituri after 1 July 2002, and
indicates that Rwanda backed the UPC and was particularly involved within the

UPC. It would seem that Rwanda was supplying not only ammunition and arms to
the UPC, but also soldiers.293 The evidence admitted for the purpose of the
confirmation hearing also includes indications that Rwanda was advising the UPC.294
There is also substantial evidence before the Chamber to the effect that Uganda
stopped backing the UPC as a result of the UPC’s alliance with Rwanda.295
222. In this regard, [REDACTED] presents a diagram summarising the “chain of
command […], or at least […] the power games played out in the relations that the
UPC’s main players had with the Hema community and the UPC’s main ally,
Rwanda.“
296 The diagram indicates that orders were issued directly from Rwanda
through its President and the Hema community. The witness states that
[REDACTED] understanding of the UPC chain of command is based exclusively on
the explanations [REDACTED].
223. In addition, the Chamber observes that according to the same [REDACTED],
“Bosco [Ntaganda] had more of a hold over the UPC’s Rwandan-speaking
militiamen. [REDACTED] confirmed to [REDACTED] that Bosco [Ntaganda]
received his orders as much from Kigali as from Lubanga.“
297 From his statement, it
would also seem that during the fighting in Bunia in March 2003, Floribert Kisembo
himself “received contradictory orders from his two masters: on the one hand he had
gotten orders from Thomas LUBANGA, and on the other hand he had gotten orders
from Kigali.“

224. [REDACTED] also refers to military assistance from Rwanda, which supplied
ammunition and arms and sent instructors to Mandro Camp.
299
225. In addition, the Chamber recalls that [REDACTED] points out in
[REDACTED] testimony that relations between the UPC and Rwanda would come to
the fore again starting in late 2002.300
226. However, in light of the paucity of evidence before it, the Chamber is not in a
position to find that there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to
believe that Rwanda played a role that can be described as direct or indirect
intervention in the armed conflict in Ituri.
b. From 2 June 2003 to December 2003: Existence of an armed
conflict not of an international character involving the UPC
227. The Document Containing the Charges, filed by the Prosecution on 28 August
2006, states that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo committed war crimes under article
8(2)(e)(vii) of the Statute between July 2002 and December 2003. It is therefore
necessary to review the events that occurred between 2 June 2003 and late December
2003.
228. Article 8(2)(e)(vii) of the Statute deals with “other serious violations of the
laws and customs applicable in armed conflicts not of an international character.”
229. Article 8(2)(f) of the Statute defines “conflicts not of an international character”
for the purposes of article 8(2)(e) of the Statute, and provides that:
Paragraph 2(e) applies to armed conflicts not of an international character and thus
does not apply to situations of internal disturbances and tensions, such as riots,
isolated and sporadic acts of violence or other acts of a similar nature. It applies to
armed conflicts that take place in the territory of a State when there is protracted
armed conflict between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or
between such groups.

No. 01/04-01/06 79/157 29 January 2007
Official Court Translation
230. In addition, the introduction to the chapter of the Elements of Crimes dealing
with this provision states that “[t]he elements for war crimes under article 8,
paragraph 2, of the Statute shall be interpreted within the established framework of
the international law of armed conflict.”
231. In this connection, the Chamber notes that Protocol Additional II to the Geneva
Conventions of 8 June 1977, which applies to non-international armed conflicts only,
sets out criteria for distinguishing between non-international armed conflicts and
situations of internal disturbances and tensions. According to its Article 1.1, Protocol
Additional II applies to armed conflicts “which take place in the territory of a High
Contracting Party between its armed forces and dissident armed forces or other
organized armed groups which, under responsible command, exercise such control
over a part of its territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted
military operations and to implement this Protocol.”
232. Thus, in addition to the requirement that the violence must be sustained and
have reached a certain degree of intensity, Article 1.1 of Protocol Additional II
provides that the armed groups must: i) be under responsible command implying
some degree of organisation of the armed groups, capable of planning and carrying
out sustained and concerted military operations and imposing discipline in the name
of a de facto authority, including the implementation of the Protocol; and ii) exercise
such control over territory as to enable them to carry out sustained and concerted
military operations.301
233. The ICTY Appeals Chamber has held that an armed conflict not of an
international character exists whenever there is a resort to “protracted armed
violence between governmental authorities and organized armed groups or between
such groups within a State.”302 This definition echoes the two criteria of Protocol

301 International Committee of the Red Cross, Commentary on the Additional Protocols of 8 June 1977 to the
Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, Geneva, Sandoz, Swinarski and Zimmermann (eds), 1986,

Additional II, except that the ability to carry out sustained and concerted military
operations is no longer linked to territorial control. It follows that the involvement of
armed groups with some degree of organisation and the ability to plan and carry out
sustained military operations would allow for the conflict to be characterised as an
armed conflict not of an international character.
234. The Chamber notes that article 8(2)(f) of the Statute makes reference to
“protracted armed conflict between […] [organized armed groups]“. In the opinion
of the Chamber, this focuses on the need for the armed groups in question to have
the ability to plan and carry out military operations for a prolonged period of time.
235. In the instant case, the Chamber finds that an armed conflict of a certain
degree of intensity and extending from at least June 2003 to December 2003 existed
on the territory of Ituri. In fact, many armed attacks were carried out during that
period,303 causing many victims.304 In addition, at the time, the Security Council also
adopted a resolution under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations and was
actively seized of this matter during the entire period in question.305

303 MONUC’s Special Report on the Events in Ituri, January 2002-December 2003 (DRC-OTP-0129-0394)
mentions the following attacks: 10 June 2003: Lendus attack Nioka; 11 June 2003: Lendu and Ngiti
militias attack Kasenyi; 6 and 7 July 2003: Lendus and Ngitis attack Ambe and the surrounding areas;
15 July 2003: the same militias attack Tchomia killing ten (more than 80 according to the Interim report
of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 24 October
2003, DRC-OTP-0130-0283, para. 41); 19 July 2003: FNI and FAPC attack Fataki; 23 July 2003, Ngiti
militia attack Kaseyni; 5 August 2003: FNI and FAPC attack Fataki; 22 August 2003: reports of
massacre in Gobu; late August–early September 2003: reports of new attacks against the population of
Fataki; 6 October 2003: Lendu forces attack Kachele. See also UPC attack on Mongbwalu on 10 June
2003, not mentioned in the various United Nations reports, but described with some precision in the
Human Rights Watch report, The Curse of Gold (DRC-OTP-0163-0399 to DRC-OTP-0163-0400) and also
mentioned in the Statement of [REDACTED](DRC-OTP-0126-0139, para. 68 ff).
304 According to MONUC’s Special Report on the Events in Ituri, January 2002-December 2003, the abovementioned attacks caused approximately 400 deaths. Furthermore, for the whole of the period in
question, the hostilities in Ituri caused the displacement of tens of thousands of people. See, for
example, paragraph 82 of the Special Report: “[t]he total of the new internally displaced persons as a
result of the May events in Bunia was reportedly 180,000 persons.“ (DRC-OTP-0129-0358).
305 See Security Council resolution S/RES/1493 of 28 July 2003: “Deeply concerned by the continuation of
hostilities in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly in North and South
Kivu and in Ituri, and by the grave violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law
that accompany them“, the Security Council “[a]uthorizes MONUC to use all necessary means to fulfil
its mandate in the Ituri district […] [r]equests the Secretary-General to deploy in the Ituri district, as
soon as possible, the tactical brigade-size force […] by mid-August 2003“ (DRC-OTP-0131-0161,

236. The Chamber also finds that there are substantial grounds to believe that
between 2 June and late December 2003, the armed conflict in Ituri involved, inter
alia, the UPC, PUSIC and the FNI;306 that the UPC and the FNI fought over control of
the gold-mining town of Mongbwalu;307 that various attacks were carried out by the
FNI in Ituri during this period;308 that a political statement was signed in mid-August
2003 in Kinshasa by the main armed groups operating in Ituri calling on the
transitional government to organise “[TRANSLATION] a meeting with us, current
political and military actors on the ground, so as to nominate by consensus, new
administrative officials for appointment;”309 that at the very beginning of November
2003, the UPC carried out a military operation against the town of Tchomia, which
was then under PUSIC control;310 and, finally, that the UPC/FPLC armed forces
controlled the towns of Iga Barrière and Nizi at the very least in December 2003.311

preamble and paras. 26 and 27). See also the Fourteenth Report of the Secretary-General on the United

fighting and conflict continued in Ituri […].“ (DRC-OTP-0130-0409, paras. 2 and 3).
306 See various attacks carried out by the FNI mentioned in MONUC’s Special Report on the Events in
Ituri, January 2002-December 2003.
307 See Human Rights Watch, The Curse of Gold (DRC-OTP-0163-0410): “After the Ugandan forces had
left in May 2003, the UPC retook Mongbwalu on June 10, 2003. […] The UPC was able to hold the
town for only forty-eight hours before being pushed back by the FNI combatants under the command
of Mateso Ninga“. See also the Statement of [REDACTED] (DRC-OTP-0126-0122), who, after
recounting the capture of the town of Bunia in May 2003, stated that “[t]he next weeks were extremely
frenetic. We initiated a campaign to retake the Lendu villages of Djugu and especially Mongbwalu
under the orders of Commanders BOSCO, KISEMBO and SALUMU MULENDA.” (DRC-OTP-0126-
0139, para. 68). In the paragraphs that follow, the witness describes the UPC debacle, thus
corroborating the Human Rights Watch report.

the latter controlled by UPC militia and the former by FNI. In the UPC-controlled Iga Barrière area, the
former headquarters of the Kilo Moto Mining Company, the Section staff saw that three quarters of a
mine pit team were under 18 years of age, most being between 11 and 15. Sources at the site alleged

237. The Chamber finds that there are substantial grounds to believe that these
three armed groups were in fact organised armed groups within the meaning of
article 8(2)(f) of the Statute. Thus, it seems clear that the FNI was capable of carrying
out large-scale military operations for a prolonged period of time.312 In addition, none
of the participants at the confirmation hearing appear to dispute the fact that these
were indeed organised groups. The Defence itself stated that very soon after their
creation, PUSIC and the FNI succeeded in gaining lasting control over territories
previously controlled by the UPC/FPLC.313
B. Existence of the offence under articles 8(2)(b)(xxvi) and 8(2)(e)(vii) of the
Statute
238. The application of articles 8(2)(b)(xxvi) and 8(2)(e)(vii) of the Statute is
predicated upon a showing that the offence as such has been committed.
239. The relevant parts of article 8(2) read as follows:
2. For the purpose of this Statute, “war crimes“ means:
(b) Other serious violations of the laws and customs applicable in international
armed conflict, within the established framework of international law,
namely, any of the following acts:
[…]
(xxvi) Conscripting or enlisting children under the age of fifteen years into
the national armed forces or using them to participate actively in hostilities;
[…]
(d) Other serious violations of the laws and customs applicable in armed
conflicts not of an international character, within the established framework
of international law, namely, any of the following acts:

para. 155). See also Fifteenth Report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations Organization Mission in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo: “there have been some 20 separate attacks on the Mission,
including on its aircraft and patrols in Kasenyi (16 January) and near Iga Barrière (19 and 20 January).“
This report also states that a MONUC staff member was killed by a member of the UPC-L (DRC-OTP0130-0462, para. 25).

part of four of the territories of Ituri, and the territory of Djugu, Mahagi, Aru and Irumu. […] It should
be added to that, to be completely precise here, that this situation was a situation which lasted [only]
until November 2002, because from November 2002 the control of the government – [and of the] FPLC
was very seriously diminished by the creation of the militia, which I've already spoken about. The first
was PUSIC with Chief Kahwa, [then] the FPDC and the FNI, just to mention a few of them.”

[…]
(vii) Conscripting or enlisting children under the age of fifteen years into
armed forces or groups or using them to participate actively in hostilities“
240. The Elements of Crimes pertaining to these two sub-paragraphs of article 8
read as follows, (the text between parentheses relates to armed conflicts not of an
international character):
1. The perpetrator conscripted or enlisted one or more persons into the national
armed forces (an armed force or group) or used one or more persons to
participate actively in hostilities.
2. Such person or persons were under the age of 15 years.
3. The perpetrator knew or should have known that such person or persons were
under the age of 15 years.
4. The conduct took place in the context of and was associated with an
international armed conflict (an armed conflict not of an international character).
5. The perpetrator was aware of factual circumstances that established the
existence of an armed conflict.
241. The Chamber will first analyse those elements that are common to the crimes,
whether committed in the context of a conflict of an international character or in the
context of a conflict not of an international character. It will then turn its attention to
the concepts of “national armed forces” and “armed force or group”.
1. Enlisting or conscripting children under the age of fifteen years
242. The concept of children participating in armed conflicts emerged in
international law in 1977 during the drafting of the Protocols Additional to the
Geneva Conventions.
243. In this regard, the Chamber recalls that Article 77(2) of Protocol Additional I
which applies to international armed conflicts, provides that:
The Parties to the conflict shall take all feasible measures in order that children
who have not attained the age of fifteen years do not take a direct part in hostilities
and, in particular, they shall refrain from recruiting them into their armed forces.
In recruiting among those persons who have attained the age of fifteen years but
who have not attained the age of eighteen years the Parties to the conflict shall
endeavour to give priority to those who are oldest.

Article 43(3) of Protocol Additional II, which applies to non-international armed
conflicts, provides that:
Children shall be provided with the care and aid they require, and in particular:
(c) children who have not attained the age of fifteen years shall neither be
recruited in the armed forces or groups nor allowed to take part in
hostilities;
244. The term used in this article – recruitment – differs from those used in the
Rome Statute – enlisting and conscripting. Whereas the preparatory work of the
Protocols Additional appears to consider only the prohibition against forcible
recruitment,314 the commentary on Article 4(3)(c) of Protocol Additional II refers to
“[t]he principle that children should not be recruited into the armed forces“ and
makes clear that this principle “also prohibits accepting voluntary enlistment.”315
245. Numerous international instruments have since been adopted, prohibiting the
recruitment of minors of a certain age.316 A review of these international instruments
and the two Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions shows that a distinction
can be drawn as to the very nature of the recruitment, that is to say between forcible
and voluntary recruitment.317

Organisation.
317 Reference is made to “compulsory recruitment“ (Article 2 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention
on the Rights of the Child) and “voluntary recruitment“ (Article 3 of the Optional Protocol to the
Convention on the Rights of the Child); this dichotomy is also reflected in the concluding observations of
the Committee on the Rights of the Child: “children have been forcibly recruited” (Belize, UN
Document CRC/C/15/Add.99), “voluntary or forced recruitment“ (Mozambique, UN Document
CRC/C/15/Add.172).

246. The Rome Statute prefers the terms “conscripting” and “enlisting”318 to
“recruitment”. In light of the foregoing, the Chamber holds the view that
“conscripting” and “enlisting” are two forms of recruitment, “conscripting” being
forcible recruitment, while “enlisting” pertains more to voluntary recruitment. In this
regard, the Chamber points out that this distinction was also made by Judge
Robertson in his separate opinion appended to the judgement rendered by the
Appeals Chamber of the Special Court for Sierra Leone319 on 31 May 2004 in the case
of The Prosecutor v. Sam Hinga Norman.320
247. It follows therefore that enlisting is a “voluntary” act, whilst conscripting is
forcible recruitment. In other words, the child’s consent is not a valid defence.
248. Finally, the Chamber considers that the crime of enlisting and conscripting is
an offence of a continuing nature – referred to by some courts as a “continuous
crime“ and by others as a “permanent crime“. The crime of enlisting or conscripting
children under the age of fifteen years continues to be committed as long as the

318 The Report of the Preparatory Committee on the establishment of an International Criminal Court
(A/CONF.183/2/Add.1) proposed the following alternatives to this article:
Option 1: forcing children under the age of fifteen years to take direct part in hostilities
Option 2: recruiting children under the age of fifteen years into armed forces or using them to
participate actively in hostilities
Option 3: i) recruiting children under the age of fifteen years into armed forces or groups; or ii)
allowing them to take part in hostilities.
319 Article 4(c) of the Statute of the Special Court for Sierra Leone was adopted in light of the provisions of
the Rome Statute. See Letter dated 22 December 2000 from the President of the Security Council
addressed to the Secretary-General (S/2000/1234), which states as follows: “[t]he members suggest the
following further adjustments of a technical or drafting nature to the Agreement […] to article 4(c) of
the Statute of the Court, modifying it so as to conform it to the statement of the law existing in 1996
and as currently accepted by the international community“.
320 The Prosecutor v. Sam Hinga Norman, Case No. SCSL-2004-14-AR72(E), Decision on preliminary motion
based on lack of jurisdiction (child recruitment), 31 May 2004. In his separate opinion, Judge Robertson
emphasised that “this crime of child recruitment, as it was finally formulated in 4(c) of the Statute,
may be committed in three quite different ways: a) by conscripting children (which implies
compulsion, albeit in some cases through force of law); b) by enlisting them (which merely means
accepting and enrolling them when they volunteer), or c) by using them to participate actively in
hostilities (i.e. taking the more serious step, having conscripted or enlisted them, of putting their lives
directly at risk in combat).“

children remain in the armed groups or forces and consequently ceases to be
committed when these children leave the groups or reach age fifteen.321
a. Conscripting and enlisting children under the age of fifteen
years by the UPC/FPLC between July 2002 and 2 June 2003
249. The Chamber finds that there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial
grounds to believe that children under the age of fifteen years were enlisted and
conscripted into the UPC/FPLC from July 2002 to 2 June 2003.
250. Indeed, the Chamber notes that some evidence admitted for the purpose of the
confirmation hearing shows that, even prior to the founding of the FPLC, the UPC
allegedly enlisted and conscripted children under the age of fifteen years.322 The
Chamber observes that after its founding in early September 2002, the FPLC
continued to carry out this type of recruitment, that this was a systematic practice
which was known to the Hema population and which targeted a large number of
children.323

321 Moreover, as stated in the Decision on the Prosecution’s application for a warrant of arrest, Article 58,
each instance of individual enlistment or conscription into a national armed force or armed group or
use to participate actively in hostilities of children under the age of fifteen constitutes a crime within
the jurisdiction of the Court. However, the Chamber considers that it is advisable to treat 1) all
instances of enlistment into a national armed force or armed group, 2) all instances of conscription into
a national armed force or armed group, and 3) all instances of use to participate actively in hostilities
of children under the age of fifteen years, as a continuous war crime (ICC-01/04-01/06-1-US-Exp-Corr.,

children, for military service. A similar operation was carried out in Salongo where the UPC
surrounded a neighbourhood and then abducted all the children they could find. At the end of
November, a school director complained that half of his students had been lost and spoke openly
against the forcible recruitment. The Mothers Forum of Ituri complained to UPC President Lubanga in
late 2002 about the recruitment of children. The UPC opened a small demobilization centre, but,
according to local people, this was a mere public relations gimmick; the recruitment of children
continued.“) MONUC, Special Report on the Events in Ituri, January 2002-December 2003: “there can be no

251. On the evidence admitted for the purpose of the confirmation hearing, the
Chamber finds that as part of this recruitment policy, many children under the age of
fifteen years were allegedly forced to join the FPLC, that the FPLC allegedly forcibly
recruited groups of children in several localities in Ituri such as the areas
surrounding Bunia in August 2002,324 in Sota at the beginning of 2003325 and in
Centrale.326 Furthermore, on the evidence admitted for the purpose of the
confirmation hearing, it also emerges that these forcible recruitments were allegedly
carried out by FPLC commanders327 and that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo himself
allegedly participated on at least one occasion in the conscription of a group of
children, some of whom were under the age of fifteen years.328
252. In addition, other children under the age of fifteen years “voluntarily” joined
the ranks of the FPLC or were made available to the FPLC by their parents, in
particular after calls for mobilisation directed at the Hema population; others joined
out of a desire for revenge after the loss of a close relative allegedly killed by the
militias fighting against the FPLC.329 The FPLC allegedly accepted them, thus
implementing an enlistment policy.330

years old – throughout the district of Ituri“ (DRC-OTP-0129-0373, para. 138) and “[r]ecruitment into all
armed groups has been both “voluntary“ and through abduction, often as the children were in the
markets or in the streets where they were forced to get into trucks and taken away. UPC recruitment
drives took place regularly throughout 2002 and early 2003“ (DRC-OTP-0129-0373, para. 143). In this

253. The Chamber holds the view that the evidence admitted for the purpose of the
confirmation hearing is sufficient to establish that there are substantial grounds to
believe that the recruitment policy established by the FPLC also affected minors
under the age of fifteen years.331
b. Conscripting and enlisting children under the age of fifteen
years by the FPLC between 2 June 2003 and late December

254. The Chamber finds that there are substantial grounds to believe that children
under the age of fifteen years were still present in the ranks of the FPLC between 2
June and late December 2003.
255. In this regard, by a decree dated 1 June 2003, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, in his
capacity as President of the UPC/RP, ordered the demobilisation from the FPLC of
any individual under the age of eighteen years. He tasked the National Secretary for
Follow-up and Monitoring and the FPLC Chief of General Staff with executing the

the war effort by providing a cow, money, or a child for the UPC/RP's rebel militia.” (DRC-OTP-0074-

decree.332 Thus, on 5 June 2003, the FPLC Chief of General Staff, Commander
Floribert Kisembo, forwarded the order to several FPLC brigades requesting the
demobilisation of any person under the age of eighteen within their ranks.333
However, [REDACTED] on the extent to which the decree had been executed,
[REDACTED], “this order has not been executed.”334
256. When asked at the hearing about the 1 June 2003 Child Demobilization
Decree, Kristine Peduto had this to say:
I would refer to them as a masquerade, given that recruitment was going on in
other parts of Ituri by UPC troops. Indeed, there was an official statement. Some
children were instructed to approach the NGOs specialising in child protection but,
at the same time, recruitment continued and the UPC never had only 70 child
soldiers amongst its troops.
Yes, the operation – I don’t know – well, yes, perhaps a public relations operation,
which was absolutely not sincere and which wasn’t presented and which never
was the first step towards cooperation. It could have been a first step towards a
more general demobilisation and the protection organisations, be they MONUC,
UNICEF or other organisations, if they had been better able to meet the needs of
UPC, could have been contacted to work to meet the needs of the children in a
sincere fashion, but this was never the case, and that is why this effort never struck
me as being serious, not least given that representatives of the UPC were regularly
at the MONUC several times a week – they knew us very well, they knew all of the
organisations. The leaders of the UPC could have contacted us very simply, either
directly or through the interim administration to request a working meeting. Such
meetings were always postponed and never took place – never.335
257. Similarly, the MONUC report on events in Ituri between January 2002 and
December 2003 states, at paragraphs 155 and 156:
In December 2003, the Child Protection Section visited the Kilo-Etat and Iga
Barrière/Nizi areas, where there are gold fields, the latter controlled by UPC militia
and the former by FNI. In the UPC-controlled Iga-Barrière area, the former
headquarters of the Kilo Moto Mining Company, the Section staff saw that three
quarters of a mine pit team were under 18 years of age, most being between 11 and
15. Sources at the site alleged that the children present in the mine were all active
or former child soldiers who worked on behalf of their UPC commanders. […]

Sixteen UPC commanders, without following procedures, reportedly released
scores of children in November [2003], telling them to go to Bunia where they were
led to believe that “a school for child soldiers“ had been set up. Many of them
turned up at MONUC offices or one of the Transit and Orientation Centres.
336
258. Accordingly, the Chamber finds that there is sufficient evidence to establish
substantial grounds to believe that from 2 June to late December 2003, in the context
of an armed conflict not of an international character, the FPLC enlisted and
conscripted children under the age of fifteen years into its armed group.
2. Active participation in hostilities
259. Regarding the involvement of children in armed conflicts, Article 77(2) of
Protocol Additional I to the Geneva Conventions337 states that:
The Parties to the conflict shall take all feasible measures in order that children
who have not attained the age of fifteen years do not take a direct part in hostilities
[…].
260. According to the commentary on Article 77(2) of Protocol Additional I to the
Geneva Conventions, the intention of the drafters of the article was clearly to keep
children under fifteen outside armed conflict, and consequently they should not be
required to perform services such as the gathering and transmission of military
information, transportation of arms and ammunition or the provision of supplies.338
261. “Active participation“ in hostilities means not only direct participation in
hostilities, combat in other words, but also covers active participation in combat-

336 In addition, according to paragraph 142 of the Fourteenth Report of the Secretary-General on the United
Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC-OTP-0130-0409) “[f]ew new
reports of recruitment have been received over the past few months. Nevertheless, current estimates
suggest that there are still several thousand children – possibly around 6,000 – in UPC, FAPC, FNI,
FRPI, FPDC and PUSIC, with many more attached to loosely-formed local defence forces or militia.“

related activities such as scouting, spying, sabotage and the use of children as decoys,
couriers or at military check-points.339
262. In this respect, the Chamber considers that this article does not apply if the
activity in question is clearly unrelated to hostilities. Accordingly, this article does
not apply to food deliveries to an airbase or the use of domestic staff in married
officers’ quarters.
263. Nevertheless, the Chamber finds that articles 8(2)(b)(xxvi) and 8(2)(e)(vii)
apply if children are used to guard military objectives, such as the military quarters
of the various units of the parties to the conflict, or to safeguard the physical safety of
military commanders (in particular, where children are used as bodyguards).340 These
activities are indeed related to hostilities in so far as i) the military commanders are
in a position to take all the necessary decisions regarding the conduct of hostilities, ii)
they have a direct impact on the level of logistic resources and on the organisation of
operations required by the other party to the conflict whose aim is to attack such
military objectives.
264. In view of these considerations, the Chamber finds that in the instant case
there are substantial grounds to believe that the FPLC used children under the age of
fifteen years to participate actively in hostilities.
265. Indeed, the Chamber notes that after their recruitment, children were
allegedly taken to FPLC training camps in Centrale (12 km north of Bunia),341 Mandro
(15 km east of Bunia),342 Rwampara (13 km south-west of Bunia),343 Irumu (55 km

notes that evidence admitted for the purpose of the confirmation hearing indicates
that, as a general rule, the children began military training the day following their
arrival at the camp;348 the military training could last up to two months;349 much of
the evidence shows that new recruits were trained in a systematic and organised
fashion in that they were subjected to rigorous and strict discipline,350 including

Chamber would like to point out that:
1. Lubanga considers them as soldiers in his speech when he says: “Soldiers… Even those who
have weapons… Even those who have pieces of wood… even those with empty… hands… “
(video DRC-OTP-0120-0293, minute 08:10);
2. There is no difference in the conduct of the children and that of the uniformed soldiers. The
children act and behave as soldiers and obey orders. (video DRC-OTP-0120-0293,
minute 11:13);
3. There is no difference as far as the weapons are concerned: uniformed soldiers also have
sticks. These sticks are used as genuine weapons, even in the military parade. (video DRCOTP-0120-0293, minute 29:55 and 31:10). Lubanga states that “[w]e are making that effort. …
For you to finish the training, for you to get a weapon […]“. (video DRC-OTP-0120-0293,
minute 14:50); and
4. There is no difference in terms of uniforms: children are among the uniformed soldiers, all of
them are lined up in military formation. Ntaganda, who is introduced as the Chief of Staff,
does not wear a uniform either. Sometimes uniforms were only handed out at the end of the
training. (see DRC-OTP-0108-0070, para. 31).

marching, taking up positions and running,351 as well as compelling them to sing

end of their training, they often received a military uniform, a firearm and

training, the children were deemed fit for combat355 and that FPLC commanders then
sent them to the front line to fight. The evidence admitted for the purpose of the
confirmation hearing does show that children under the age of fifteen years

267. In addition, the Chamber finds that there is sufficient evidence to establish
substantial grounds to believe that children under the age of fifteen years were also
used as bodyguards by the FPLC commanders363 and that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo
personally used them.364 It appears that these children were then asked to safeguard
the physical safety of FPLC commanders, even during military deployments, a
practice which directly endangered their own personal safety.365 These bodyguards,
who included children under the age of fifteen years, were also responsible for
protecting the general staff headquarters located in Bunia.366
3. Discrete elements in the two articles: “into the national armed forces“ or
“into armed forces or groups“
268. Under article 8(2)(b)(xxvi) of the Statute, conscripting or enlisting children
under the age of fifteen years into national armed forces and using them to
participate actively in hostilities constitutes a serious violation of the laws and
customs applicable in international armed conflict, within the established framework
of international law.
269. This article of the Statute derives from Article 77 of Protocol Additional I to the
Geneva Conventions, which deals with the protection of children during armed
conflicts of an international character.

270. Pursuant to Article 77(2) of Protocol Additional I to the Geneva Conventions,
“[t]he Parties to the conflict shall take all feasible measures in order that children who
have not attained the age of fifteen years do not take a direct part in hostilities and, in
particular, they shall refrain from recruiting them into their armed forces.“
271. The Chamber considers that the expression “national armed forces“ must first
be defined. In this regard, Article 43 of Protocol Additional I to the Geneva Conventions
of 12 August 1949 defines the armed forces of a Party to a conflict as consisting of all
organised armed forces, groups and units which are under a command responsible to
that Party for the conduct of its subordinates, even if that Party is represented by a
government or an authority not recognized by an adverse Party. Such armed forces
must be subject to an internal disciplinary system which, inter alia, enforces
compliance with the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict.
272. The Chamber notes that, in the context of a conflict of an international
character, Protocol Additional I does not require that the armed forces be
governmental forces. In this regard, the Chamber refers to the commentary on the
Protocol, which states that “it is perfectly clear that the Protocol has extended its field
of application to entities which are not States. […] If they conform to the
requirements of the present article, liberation movements fighting against colonial
domination […] and resistance movements representing a pre-existing subject of
international law may be “Parties to the conflict“ within the meaning of the
Conventions and the Protocol. However, the authority which represents them must
have certain characteristics of a government, at least in relation to its armed forces.“367
273. The commentary on Article 43 of Protocol I states that the notion of “party to
the conflict“ is fairly wide, involving not only resistance movements representing a
pre-existing subject of international law and governments in exile, but also those
fighting for conflicts of “self-determination“ or “national liberation“.

274. Furthermore, the Chamber notes that Article 1 of the 1907 Hague Regulations
concerning the Laws and Customs of War, which has become part of customary law,368
also requires militia and volunteer corps that are not part of an army to fulfil the
following conditions: be commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;
have a fixed distinctive emblem recognizable at a distance; carry arms openly; and
conduct their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.
275. With regard to the term “national“, which qualifies armed forces in the context
of article 8(2)(b)(xxvi) of the Statute, the Chamber recalls that the context of
international armed conflict is not restricted solely to the use of force between two
states, but that it extends to certain situations in which parties to the conflict may be
organised armed forces or groups. The issue raised here is whether the adjective
“national“ qualifying the term “armed forces“ limits the scope of the application of
this provision to “governmental“ armed forces.
276. In this regard, Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, entitled
“General rule of interpretation“, provides that:
1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its
object and purpose.
[…]
4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties
so intended.
277. Firstly, the ordinary meaning of the adjective “national“ does not necessarily
lead to an interpretation of the term as meaning governmental armed forces. In this
regard, the Chamber notes that the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY defined the term
“national“369 within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the Fourth Geneva Convention for
the purpose of determining who can be considered a “protected person“ under the
Convention.

Official Court Translation
278. On this point, the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY held in Tadić that “in modern
inter-ethnic armed conflicts such as that in the former Yugoslavia, new States are
often created during the conflict and ethnicity rather than nationality may become
the grounds for allegiance. Or, put another way, ethnicity may become determinative
of national allegiance. […] In such conflicts, not only the text and the drafting history
of the Convention but also, and more importantly, the Convention’s object and
purpose suggest that allegiance to a Party to the conflict and, correspondingly,
control by this Party over persons in a given territory, may be regarded as the crucial
test.“370
279. In The Prosecutor v. Delalić et al., the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY held that
“Bosnian Serb victims should be regarded as protected persons for the purposes of
Geneva Convention IV because they were arrested and detained mainly on the basis
of their Serb identity and they were clearly regarded by the Bosnian authorities as
belonging to the opposing party in an armed conflict and as posing a threat to the
Bosnian State.“371
280. Accordingly, the Chamber observes that the Appeals Chamber of the ICTY has
construed the term “national“372 in Article 4(1) of the Fourth Geneva Convention as
referring not solely to nationality as such, but also to the fact of belonging to the
opposing party in an armed conflict.
281. Secondly, interpreting the term “national“ to mean “governmental“ can only
undermine the object and purpose of the Statute of the Court, which is none other
than to ensure that “the most serious crimes of concern to the international
community as a whole“ must no longer go unpunished.373

Statute.

No. 01/04-01/06 98/157 29 January 2007
Official Court Translation
282. Thus, construing the term “national“ to mean “governmental“ might present
the judge with a genuine paradox. Indeed, he or she might be led to consider that an
alleged perpetrator can be held responsible if he or she belongs to a party to a conflict
which is linked to a State (the armed forces of a State, such as the UPDF), but would
escape prosecution if he or she belonged to a party to the same conflict described as
an armed group (such as the FPLC).
283. Moreover, Article 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, entitled
“Supplementary means of interpretation“ states that:
Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the
preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to
confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine
the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:
a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or
b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.
284. In fact, on the basis of basic humanitarian considerations and common sense,
it would be absurd that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo could incur criminal responsibility
for the crime of enlisting or conscripting children under the age of fifteen years only
in the context of an internal armed conflict solely because the FPLC, as an armed
force, could not be described as a “national armed force“ within the meaning of
article 8(2)(b)(xxvi) of the Statute. This would be tantamount to admitting that the
perpetrator of such a crime could escape prosecution simply because his or her acts
were committed in the context of an international armed conflict. The drafters of the
Statute wanted to include under article 8 of the Statute a larger array of criminal
conduct committed in the context of an international armed conflict.
285. Thus, the Chamber considers that, under article 8(2)(b)(xxvi) of the Statute, the
term “the national armed forces“ is not limited to the armed forces of a State.
C. Existence of a nexus between the armed conflict and the alleged crimes
286. A war crime is committed if there is a nexus between the criminal act in
question and the armed conflict. As previously stated, the Elements of Crimes
ICC-01/04-01/06-803-tEN 14-05-2007 98/157 SL PT
No. 01/04-01/06 99/157 29 January 2007
Official Court Translation
require that the conduct in question took place in the context of and was associated
with an armed conflict.
287. In this respect, the Chamber follows the approach of the jurisprudence of the
ICTY,374 which requires the conduct to have been closely related to the hostilities
occurring in any part of the territories controlled by the parties to the conflict. The
armed conflict need not be considered the ultimate reason for the conduct and the
conduct need not have taken place in the midst of battle. Nonetheless, the armed
conflict must play a substantial role in the perpetrator’s decision, in his or her ability
to commit the crime or in the manner in which the conduct was ultimately
committed.
288. Having established the existence of an armed conflict, the Chamber observes
that in order for a particular crime to qualify as a war crime within the meaning of
articles 8(2)(b)(xxvi) and 8(2)(e)(vii) of the Statute, at this stage, the Prosecution must
establish that there are substantial grounds to believe that there is a sufficient and
clear nexus between that crime and the conflict. In other words, it must be proved
that there are substantial grounds to believe that the alleged crimes were closely
related to the hostilities.375
289. On the evidence admitted for the purpose of the confirmation hearing, the
Chamber considers that there are substantial grounds to believe that children under
the age of fifteen years were enlisted and conscripted in order to undergo a short
military training lasting less than two months during which they learnt how to use
weapons, among other skills.376 The purpose of the training seems to have been to use

under the age of fifteen years reportedly remained in the service of FPLC
commanders up until the end of December 2003.385
293. Accordingly, the Chamber considers that there are substantial grounds to
believe that the conduct took place in the context of and was associated with an
armed conflict in Ituri between July 2002 and late December 2003 and in which the
UPC/RP and the FPLC were key players.

V. THE PRINCIPLE OF LEGALITY AND MISTAKE OF LAW
294. At the confirmation hearing, the Defence argued that the principle of legality
of sentences and crimes required the Chamber to make a threshold determination
whether Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was aware of the existence of the crime of enlisting
and conscripting children under the age of fifteen years and using them to participate
actively in hostilities and whether he could foresee that the conduct in question was
criminal in nature and could therefore entail his criminal responsibility.
295. The Defence maintains that Article 64 of the Fourth Geneva Convention must
apply since the armed conflict was of an international character.386 This article states
that “[t]he penal laws of the occupied territory shall remain in force“. According to
the Defence, only legislation in force at the start of the occupation remains in force
and any laws passed subsequently do not apply.
296. The Defence also argues that the Rome Statute entered into force in respect of
Uganda only on 1 September 2002 and that Rwanda has not ratified it. The Defence
submits that Article 65 of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides that if the
occupying Power wishes to introduce new penal provisions, they shall not come into
force before they have been brought to the knowledge of the inhabitants. The
Defence notes that neither Uganda nor the DRC brought to the knowledge of the
inhabitants of Ituri the fact that the Rome Statute had been ratified and that
conscripting and enlisting child soldiers entailed individual criminal responsibility.387
The Defence further alleges that the principle of foreseeability, which requires the
Court to exercise its jurisdiction only over the most serious crimes of concern to the
international community as a whole, must influence the contours of the meaning of
conscription and enlistment.388 In this regard, the Defence considers that the crime of
enlisting is included neither in Protocols Additional I and II to the Geneva

Conventions, nor in the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child,
389
and therefore submits that the act of enlistment simpliciter does not correspond to any
underlying conduct which Thomas Lubanga Dyilo could foreseeably have
anticipated would entail his individual criminal responsibility.
297. The Prosecution submits that the principle of legality as defined in article 22 of
the Statute is not infringed by the Document Containing the Charges that it
presented. The Prosecution is of the view that article 32(2) of the Statute which
specifies that a mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime
within the jurisdiction of the Court shall not be a ground for excluding criminal
responsibility. Accordingly, the Prosecution considers that it is sufficient to establish
that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo had knowledge of the constituent facts of the crimes
with which he is charged.390 The Prosecution also argues that the Defence submission
that during the period covered by the charges, the rules of law criminalising the
recruitment, enlistment and use of child soldiers in hostilities were neither
foreseeable, accessible, nor defined with certainty for Thomas Lubanga Dyilo is
factually incorrect.391
298. The Representatives of Victims a/0001/06 to a/0003/06 consider that the
drafters of the Rome Statute did not intend to establish new crimes, but rather to
structure the possibility of prosecuting those crimes which international custom
already considered to be violations of humanitarian law. In support of their
allegations, they quote the Report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the
Establishment of a Special Court for Sierra Leone, which states that:
The prohibition on the recruitment of children below the age of 15, a fundamental
element of the protection of children, was for the first time established in the 1977
Additional Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions, article 4, paragraph 3(c), of which
provides that children shall be provided with the care and aid they require, and
that in particular: Children who have not attained the age of fifteen years shall
neither be recruited in the armed forces or groups nor allowed to take part in
hostilities. A decade later, the prohibition on the recruitment of children below 15

into armed forces was established in article 38, paragraph 3, of the 1989 Convention
on the Rights of the Child; and in 1998, the Statute of the International Criminal Court
criminalised the prohibition and qualified it as a war crime. But while the
prohibition on child recruitment has by now acquired a customary international
law status, it is far less clear whether it is customarily recognized as a war crime
entailing the individual criminal responsibility of the accused.392
299. In support of their position, the Representatives of Victims a/0001/06 to
a/0003/06 refer to the judgement rendered by the Appeals Chamber of the Special
Court for Sierra Leone in the case of The Prosecutor v. Sam Hinga Norman, which holds
that it is established that:
Child recruitment was criminalised before it was explicitly set out as a criminal
prohibition in treaty law and certainly by November 1996, the starting point of the
time frame relative to the indictment.393
300. The Representatives of Victims a/0001/06 to a/0003/06 consider that the issue of
the principle of legality was resolved by the entry into force of the Rome Statute,
article 22 of which clearly imposes criminal responsibility if the conduct in question
constitutes, at the time it takes place, a crime within the jurisdiction of the Court.394
301. The Chamber considers that the Defence is not relying on the principle of
legality, but on the possibility of excluding criminal responsibility on account of a
mistake of the law in force.
302. Having regard to the principle of legality, the terms enlisting, conscripting and
using children under the age of fifteen years to participate actively in hostilities are
defined with sufficient particularity in articles 8(2)(b)(xxvi) and 8(2)(e)(vii), 22 to 24
and 77 of the Rome Statute and the Elements of Crimes, which entered into force on 1
July 2002, as entailing criminal responsibility and punishable as criminal offences.
303. Accordingly, there is no infringement of the principle of legality if the
Chamber exercises its power to decide whether Thomas Lubanga Dyilo ought to be

committed for trial on the basis of written (lex scripta) pre-existing criminal norms
approved by the States Parties to the Rome Statute (lex praevia), defining prohibited
conduct and setting out the related sentence (lex certa), which cannot be interpreted
by analogy in malam partem (lex stricta).395
304. The Defence argues that, at the time, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was unaware
that voluntarily or forcibly recruiting children under the age of fifteen years and
using them to participate actively in hostilities entailed his criminal responsibility
under the Statute.
305. The Chamber observes, however, that the scope of a mistake of law within the
meaning of article 32(2) is relatively limited. Indeed, this article provides that “[a]
mistake of law as to whether a particular type of conduct is a crime within the
jurisdiction of the Court shall not be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility.“
306. In addition, the Chamber considers that there is sufficient evidence before it to
establish substantial grounds to believe that, at the time, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was
aware that voluntarily or forcibly recruiting children under the age of fifteen years
and using them to participate actively in hostilities entailed his criminal
responsibility under the Statute.
307. In reaching this finding, the Chamber notes, firstly, that the DRC ratified the
Statute of the International Criminal Court on 11 April 2002, i.e. a few months before
the period covered by the Prosecution charging document.
308. The Defence does not appear to challenge the fact that “child recruitment“ is a
violation of international humanitarian law. Nonetheless, the Chamber recalls that
children under the age of fifteen years must be considered as protected persons
within the meaning of the Geneva Conventions and the two Protocols Additional of
1977.396 In this regard, Article 77(2) of Protocol Additional I states that “the Parties to

the conflict shall take all feasible measures in order that children who have not
attained the age of fifteen years do not take a direct part in hostilities and, in
particular, they shall refrain from recruiting them into their armed forces“.397 In
construing this article and, in particular, the term “recruiting“, the Chamber relies on
the Commentary on the Additional Protocols, according to which the principle of
non-recruitment also prohibits accepting voluntary enlistment.398
309. In addition, the DRC ratified the Geneva Conventions of 1949 in 1961 and
Protocol I in 1982. Uganda ratified the Geneva Conventions in 1964 and Protocols I
and II in 1991.
310. The protection of children under international humanitarian law is also
recognised under the 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child.
399
311. Moreover, in a decision dated 31 May 2004, the Appeals Chamber of the
Special Court for Sierra Leone, after noting that most States prohibit the recruitment
of children under the age of fifteen years and are parties to the Geneva Conventions
and their Protocols Additional,400 held that, prior to November 1996, the prohibition
against child recruitment had already crystallized as a customary law norm.
312. In addition, the Chamber has given special consideration to the evidence
indicating that, even prior to 1 July 2002, the date the Statute entered into force, the
Hema and Lendu communities of Ituri were familiar with the Statute and the type of
conduct which gives rise to criminal responsibility under the Statute. In this regard,
the Chamber observes that the “Protocole d’accord relatif à la résolution du conflit inter-

401 expressly calls for governmental
authorities to work with competent international courts with a view to bringing the
alleged planners and instigators of the conflict before the International Criminal
Court.402
313. In her testimony before the Chamber, Kristine Peduto explained that on 30
May 2003 she discussed child protection issues and matters relating to the ratification
of the Rome Statute by the DRC with Thomas Lubanga Dyilo.403
314. Accordingly, the Chamber considers the following observations by the
Representatives of Victims a/0001/06 to a/0003/06 to be relevant:
[I]f many Congolese are still unaware of the existence of the International Criminal
Court, the provisions of the Rome Statute and its ratification by the DRC, a
substantial part of the population of Ituri closely followed the Statute’s entry into
force and it was greeted with relief, particularly by the many victims of war crimes.
The Statute’s entry into force could not have escaped the attention of Thomas
Lubanga, who claims to be a politician and head of state, and who, because of his
involvement in an armed conflict, was directly concerned.404
315. The Chamber also observes that article 32(2) of the Statute specifies that
mistake of law shall only be a ground for excluding criminal responsibility if (i) it
negates the mental element required by the crime or (ii) it falls within the scope of the
“superior orders“ or “prescription of law“ defence under article 33 of the Statute.
316. As a result, absent a plea under article 33 of the Statute, the defence of mistake
of law can succeed under article 32 of the Statute only if Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was
unaware of a normative objective element of the crime as a result of not realising its
social significance (its everyday meaning).405 However, there is nothing in the

VI. CRIMINAL RESPONSIBILITY
A. Modes of liability
1. Scope of the analysis
317. Pursuant to regulation 52(c) of the Regulations of the Court, the Document
Containing the Charges must include “a legal characterisation of the facts to accord
both with the crimes under articles 6, 7 or 8 and the precise form of participation
under articles 25 and 28.“
318. Accordingly, in the Document Containing the Charges, the Prosecution
charges Thomas Lubanga Dyilo with criminal responsibility under article 25(3)(a) of
the Statute, which covers the notions of direct perpetration (commission of a crime in
person), co-perpetration (commission of a crime jointly with another person) and
indirect perpetration (commission of a crime through another person, regardless of
whether that other person is criminally responsible).406
319. Furthermore, the Chamber observes that in the part of the Document
Containing the Charges dealing with individual criminal responsibility, the

406 ICC-01/04-01/06-356-Conf-Anx1, p. 27. The Chamber also points out that in paragraph 12 ii) of the
Submission of the Document Containing the Charges pursuant to article 61(3)(a) and of the List of
Evidence pursuant to rule 121(3) (ICC-01/04-01/06-356), the Prosecution also refers to the mode of
liability under article 25(3)(d) of the Statute by stating that:
In the Document Containing the Charges, the Prosecution submits that Thomas
LUBANGA DYILO is criminally responsible as a joint perpetrator pursuant to
Article 25(3)(a). The Pre-Trial Chamber found, upon review of the Arrest Warrant
Application - which relied on many of the same factual allegations as the
Document Containing the Charges - that indirect co-perpetration was also
potentially a viable theory of criminal responsibility. Based on the facts as detailed
in the Document Containing the Charges, the Office of the Prosecutor believes that
"common purpose" in terms of Article 25(3)(d) could properly be considered as a
third applicable mode of criminal liability. The Prosecution requests that the PreTrial Chamber make findings that the legal requirements of these three modes of
liability are either satisfied or not satisfied, based on its review of the materials
submitted at the Confirmation Hearing. Such findings would promote efficiency by
ensuring that in the event any of the three legal theories of criminal liability were
later deemed infirm, through events not foreseen at this time, the Parties would not
be obligated to return to the Pre-Trial Chamber to seek the confirmation of new
charges based on the same evidentiary showing.“

No. 01/04-01/06 110/157 29 January 2007
Official Court Translation
Prosecution charges Thomas Lubanga Dyilo only with individual criminal
responsibility as a co-perpetrator within the meaning of article 25(3)(a) of the Statute.
Likewise, in its closing brief, the Prosecution asserts that “[f]rom the beginning and
continuing throughout the proceedings, the Prosecution has pleaded one form of
individual criminal responsibility, namely co-perpetration pursuant to article 25(3)(a)
of the Statute“407 because it “best represents the criminal responsibility for crimes
with which Thomas Lubanga Dyilo is charged.“408
320. The Chamber recalls that in the decision concerning the issuance of a warrant
of arrest, it distinguished between (i) the commission strictu senso of a crime by a
person as an individual, jointly with another or through another person within the
meaning of article 25(3)(a) of the Statute, and (ii) the responsibility of superiors under
article 28 of the Statute and “any other forms of accessory, as opposed to principal,
liability provided for in article 25(3) (b) to (d) of the Statute“.409
321. Hence, if the Chamber finds that there is sufficient evidence to establish
substantial grounds to believe that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo is criminally responsible
as a co-perpetrator for the crimes listed in the Document Containing the Charges, for
the purpose of the confirmation of the charges, the question as to whether it may also
consider the other forms of accessory liability provided for in articles 25(3)(b) to (d)
of the Statute or the alleged superior responsibility of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo under
article 28 of the Statute becomes moot, even though these modes of liability have not
been expressly pleaded in the Document Containing the Charges.

410 Paragraph 23 of the “Written submissions of the Legal Representative of Victim a/0105/06“ (ICC01/04-01/06-745-tEN, states: “Indeed, nothing would prevent the Pre-Trial Chamber, when making a
determination as to whether there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo committed each of the crimes ascribed to him, from specifying the forms of
responsibility. This option arises from the Chamber’s inherent power to weigh the evidence tendered
and make findings at its discretion, taking into account the threshold of proof“. The same position is
held in “Observations made at the confirmation hearing on behalf of Victims a/0001/06, a/0002/06 and
a/0003/06“, ICC-01/04-01/06-750-tEN, 4 December 2006, paras. 49-54. Nevertheless, the Defence points

2. The concept of co-perpetration as embodied in the Statute
322. The concept of co-perpetration embodied in article 25(3)(a) of the Statute
requires analysis. The Prosecution is of the opinion that article 25(3)(a) of the Statute
adopts a concept of co-perpetration based on the notion of control of the crime in the
sense that a person can become a co-perpetrator of a crime only if he or she has “joint
control“ over the crime as a result of the “essential contribution“ ascribed to him or
her.411
323. The Prosecution acknowledges that the concept of co-perpetration pursuant to
article 25(3)(a) of the Statute differs from that of co-perpetration based on the
existence of a joint criminal enterprise or common purpose as reflected, in particular,
in the jurisprudence of the ICTY.412 In this regard, the Prosecution submits that it is
important to take into consideration the fundamental differences between the ad hoc
tribunals and the Court, because the latter operates under a Statute which not only
sets out modes of criminal liability in great detail, but also deliberately avoids the
broader definitions found in, for example, article 7(1) of the ICTY Statute.413
324. The Defence does not suggest any interpretation of the concept of coperpetration, but it challenges the Prosecution’s approach saying that it “goes beyond
the clear terms of co-perpetration and indirect perpetration set out in the Statute, and

judgements in the Simić and Gacumbitsi cases “have recently reversed convictions on the grounds that
the mode of liability in question was pleaded in ambiguous or insufficient terms in the indictment and
have emphasized that the need to plead with sufficient particularity is heightened with respect to
novel forms of liability“; and that (ii) “in light of the fact that the Defence raised the issue of lack of
notice prior to the confirmation hearing, the burden falls squarely on the Prosecution to prove that
failure to plead the modes of liability with sufficient clarity and particularity has not materially
impaired the preparation of the Defence.“

is not supported by either customary international law, or general principles of law

325. The Legal Representatives of Victims a/0001/06, a/0002/06, a/0003/06415 and
a/0105/06416 argue that the concept of co-perpetration set out in article 25(3)(a) of the
Statute pertains to the concept of joint criminal enterprise or common purpose
doctrine, the essential component of which is the sharing of a common criminal plan
or purpose as opposed to retaining control over the crime.
326. The Chamber is of the view that the concept of co-perpetration is originally
rooted in the idea that when the sum of the co-ordinated individual contributions of
a plurality of persons results in the realisation of all the objective elements of a crime,
any person making a contribution can be held vicariously responsible for the
contributions of all the others and, as a result, can be considered as a principal to the
whole crime.417
327. In this regard, the definitional criterion of the concept of co-perpetration is
linked to the distinguishing criterion between principals and accessories to a crime
where a criminal offence is committed by a plurality of persons.
328. The objective approach to such a distinction focuses on the realisation of one
or more of the objective elements of the crime. From this perspective, only those who
physically carry out one or more of the objective elements of the offence can be
considered principals to the crime.

414 “Defence Brief on matters the Defence raised during the confirmation hearing – Legal
Observations“, ICC-01/04-01/06-758-Conf, para. 33. The Defence alleges that the concept of joint
control over the crime was developed primarily by German theorists, in particular Claus Roxin, and
that such theories “are very much predicated on notions of hierarchy and obedience, and were
formulated to address the type of systematic criminality which existed in Germany during World War
II (as exemplified in the Eichmann case) and during the communist regime in the GDR“. ICC-01/04-
01/06-758-Conf, para. 34.

329. The subjective approach – which is the approach adopted by the jurisprudence
of the ICTY through the concept of joint criminal enterprise or the common purpose
doctrine – moves the focus from the level of contribution to the commission of the
offence as the distinguishing criterion between principals and accessories, and places
it instead on the state of mind in which the contribution to the crime was made. As a
result, only those who make their contribution with the shared intent to commit the
offence can be considered principals to the crime, regardless of the level of their
contribution to its commission.
330. The concept of control over the crime constitutes a third approach for
distinguishing between principals and accessories which, contrary to the Defence
claim, is applied in numerous legal systems.418 The notion underpinning this third
approach is that principals to a crime are not limited to those who physically carry
out the objective elements of the offence, but also include those who, in spite of being
removed from the scene of the crime, control or mastermind its commission because
they decide whether and how the offence will be committed.
331. This approach involves an objective element, consisting of the appropriate
factual circumstances for exercising control over the crime, and a subjective element,
consisting of the awareness of such circumstances.
332. According to this approach, only those who have control over the commission
of the offence – and are aware of having such control – may be principals because:
i. they physically carry out the objective elements of the offence (commission
of the crime in person, or direct perpetration);

ii. they control the will of those who carry out the objective elements of the
offence (commission of the crime through another person, or indirect
perpetration); or
iii. they have, along with others, control over the offence by reason of the
essential tasks assigned to them (commission of the crime jointly with
others, or co-perpetration).
333. Article 25(3)(a) of the Statute does not take into account the objective criterion
for distinguishing between principals and accessories because the notion of
committing an offence through another person – particularly when the latter is not
criminally responsible – cannot be reconciled with the idea of limiting the class of
principals to those who physically carry out one or more of the objective elements of
the offence.
334. Article 25(3)(a) of the Statute, read in conjunction with article 25(3)(d), also
does not take into account the subjective criteria for distinguishing between
principals and accessories. In this regard, the Chamber notes that, by moving away
from the concept of co-perpetration embodied in article 25(3)(a), article 25(3)(d)
defines the concept of (i) contribution to the commission or attempted commission of
a crime by a group of persons acting with a common purpose, (ii) with the aim of
furthering the criminal activity of the group or in the knowledge of the criminal
purpose.
335. The Chamber considers that this latter concept – which is closely akin to the
concept of joint criminal enterprise or the common purpose doctrine adopted by the
jurisprudence of the ICTY – would have been the basis of the concept of coperpetration within the meaning of article 25(3)(a), had the drafters of the Statute
opted for a subjective approach for distinguishing between principals and
accessories.

336. Moreover, the Chamber observes that the wording of article 25(3)(d) of the
Statute begins with the words “[i]n any other way contributes to the commission or
attempted commission of such a crime.“
337. Hence, in the view of the Chamber, article 25(3)(d) of the Statute provides for a
residual form of accessory liability which makes it possible to criminalise those
contributions to a crime which cannot be characterised as ordering, soliciting,
inducing, aiding, abetting or assisting within the meaning of article 25(3)(b) or article
25(3)(c) of the Statute, by reason of the state of mind in which the contributions were
made.
338. Not having accepted the objective and subjective approaches for
distinguishing between principals and accessories to a crime, the Chamber considers,
as does the Prosecution and, unlike the jurisprudence of the ad hoc tribunals, that the
Statute embraces the third approach, which is based on the concept of control over
the crime.
339. In this regard, the Chamber notes that the most typical manifestation of the
concept of control over the crime, which is the commission of a crime through
another person, is expressly provided for in article 25(3)(a) of the Statute. In addition,
the use of the phrase “regardless of whether that other person is criminally
responsible“ in article 25(3)(a) of the Statute militates in favour of the conclusion that
this provision extends to the commission of a crime not only through an innocent
agent (that is, through another person who is not criminally responsible), but also
through another person who is fully criminally responsible.419
340. The Chamber considers that the concept of co-perpetration embodied in article
25(3)(a) of the Statute by the reference to the commission of a crime “jointly with […]
another person“ must cohere with the choice of the concept of control over the crime
as a criterion for distinguishing between principals and accessories.

Court: A Commentary, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2002, Vol. I, p. 795.

341. Hence, as stated in its Decision to Issue a Warrant of Arrest,
420 the Chamber
considers that the concept of co-perpetration embodied in article 25(3)(a) of the
Statute coincides with that of joint control over the crime by reason of the essential
nature of the various contributions to the commission of the crime.421
3. Elements of co-perpetration based on joint control over the crime
342. The concept of co-perpetration based on joint control over the crime is rooted
in the principle of the division of essential tasks for the purpose of committing a
crime between two or more persons acting in a concerted manner. Hence, although
none of the participants has overall control over the offence because they all depend
on one another for its commission, they all share control because each of them could
frustrate the commission of the crime by not carrying out his or her task.422
a. Objective Elements
i) Existence of an agreement or common plan between two or
more persons
343. In the view of the Chamber, the first objective requirement of co-perpetration
based on joint control over the crime is the existence of an agreement or common
plan between two or more persons.423 Accordingly, participation in the commission
of a crime without co-ordination with one’s co-perpetrators falls outside the scope of
co-perpetration within the meaning of article 25(3)(a) of the Statute.
344. The common plan must include an element of criminality, although it does not
need to be specifically directed at the commission of a crime. It suffices:

420 “In the Chamber’s view, there are reasonable grounds to believe that, given the alleged hierarchical
relationship between Mr Thomas Lubanga Dyilo and the other members of the UPC and the FPLC, the
concept of indirect perpetration which, along with that of co-perpetration based on joint control of the
crime referred to in the Prosecution’s Application, is provided for in article 25(3)(a) of the Statute,
could be also applicable to Mr Thomas Lubanga Dyilo’s alleged role in the commission of the crimes
set out in the Prosecution’s Application.“ ICC-01/04-01/06-1-US-Exp-Conf, para. 110.

422 The Prosecutor v. Milomir Stakić, Case No. IT-97-24-T, Trial Judgement, 31 July 2003, para. 440.
423 In Stakić, the first objective requirement for co-perpetration is divided into two sub-criteria: i) a
common goal and ii) an agreement or silent consent, The Prosecutor v. Milomir Stakić, Case No. IT-97-
31-T, Trial Judgement, 24 July 2003, paras. 470-477.

Official Court Translation
i. that the co-perpetrators have agreed (a) to start the implementation of the
common plan to achieve a non-criminal goal, and (b) to only commit the
crime if certain conditions are met; or
ii. that the co-perpetrators (a) are aware of the risk that implementing the
common plan (which is specifically directed at the achievement of a noncriminal goal) will result in the commission of the crime, and (b) accept
such an outcome.
345. Furthermore, the Chamber considers that the agreement need not be explicit
and that its existence can be inferred from the subsequent concerted action of the coperpetrators.
ii) Co-ordinated essential contribution by each co-perpetrator
resulting in the realisation of the objective elements of the
crime
346. The Chamber considers that the second objective requirement of coperpetration based on joint control over the crime is the co-ordinated essential
contribution made by each co-perpetrator resulting in the realisation of the objective
elements of the crime.424
347. In the view of the Chamber, when the objective elements of an offence are
carried out by a plurality of persons acting within the framework of a common plan,
only those to whom essential tasks have been assigned – and who, consequently,
have the power to frustrate the commission of the crime by not performing their
tasks – can be said to have joint control over the crime.
348. The Chamber observes that, although some authors have linked the essential
character of a task – and hence the ability to exercise joint control over the crime – to

424 In Stakić, the second objective requirement for co-perpetration is divided into two sub-criteria: i) coordinated co-operation and ii) joint control over criminal conduct, The Prosecutor v. Milomir Stakić,

its performance at the execution stage of the crime,425 the Statute does not contain any
such restriction.
b. Subjective Elements
i) The suspect must fulfil the subjective elements of the crime
in question
349. The Chamber considers that co-perpetration based on joint control over the
crime requires above all that the suspect fulfil the subjective elements of the crime
with which he or she is charged, including any requisite dolus specialis or ulterior
intent for the type of crime involved.426
350. Article 30 of the Statute sets out the general subjective element for all crimes
within the jurisdiction of the Court by specifying that “[u]nless otherwise provided, a
person shall be criminally responsible and liable for punishment for a crime within
the jurisdiction of the Court only if the material elements are committed with intent
and knowledge“,427 that is:
i. if the person is “[aware] that a circumstance exists or a consequence will
occur in the ordinary course of events“;428 and

425 Roxin, C., Täterschaft und Tatherrschaft, Berlin, New York, Walter de Gruyter, Seventh Edition, 2000,
pp. 294 and 299. According to Roxin, those who contribute only to the commission of a crime at the
preparatory stage cannot be described as co-perpetrators even if they carry out tasks with a view to
implementing the common plan. This point of view is shared by MIR PUIG, S., Derecho Penal, Parte
General, Editorial Reppertor, Sixth Edition, 2000, p. 385; HERZEBERG, R.D., Täterschaft und Teilnahme,

ii. if the person means to engage in the relevant conduct and means to cause
the relevant consequence or is aware that it will occur in the ordinary
course of events.429
351. The cumulative reference to “intent” and “knowledge“ requires the existence
of a volitional element on the part of the suspect. This volitional element
encompasses, first and foremost, those situations in which the suspect (i) knows that
his or her actions or omissions will bring about the objective elements of the crime,
and (ii) undertakes such actions or omissions with the concrete intent to bring about
the objective elements of the crime (also known as dolus directus of the first degree).430
352. The above-mentioned volitional element also encompasses other forms of the
concept of dolus431 which have already been resorted to by the jurisprudence of the ad
hoc tribunals,432 that is:
i. situations in which the suspect, without having the concrete intent to bring
about the objective elements of the crime, is aware that such elements will
be the necessary outcome of his or her actions or omissions (also known as
dolus directus of the second degree);433 and
ii. situations in which the suspect (a) is aware of the risk that the objective
elements of the crime may result from his or her actions or omissions, and

(b) accepts such an outcome by reconciling himself or herself with it or
consenting to it (also known as dolus eventualis).434
353. The Chamber considers that in the latter type of situation, two kinds of
scenarios are distinguishable. Firstly, if the risk of bringing about the objective
elements of the crime is substantial (that is, there is a likelihood that it “will occur in
the ordinary course of events“),435 the fact that the suspect accepts the idea of
bringing about the objective elements of the crime can be inferred from:
i. the awareness by the suspect of the substantial likelihood that his or her
actions or omissions would result in the realisation of the objective
elements of the crime; and
ii. the decision by the suspect to carry out his or her actions or omissions
despite such awareness.
354. Secondly, if the risk of bringing about the objective elements of the crime is
low, the suspect must have clearly or expressly accepted the idea that such objective
elements may result from his or her actions or omissions.436
355. Where the state of mind of the suspect falls short of accepting that the
objective elements of the crime may result from his or her actions or omissions, such
a state of mind cannot qualify as a truly intentional realisation of the objective
elements,437 and hence would not meet the “intent and knowledge“ requirement
embodied in article 30 of the Statute.438

434 According to Stakić, “[t]he technical definition of dolus eventualis is the following: if the actor
engages in life-endangering behaviour, his killing becomes intentional if he “reconciles himself” or
“makes peace” with the likelihood of death.“ The Prosecutor v. Milomir Stakić, Case No. IT-97-24-T,
Trial Judgement, 31 July 2003, para. 587.
435 PIRAGOFF, D.K., “Article 30: Mental Element“, in Commentary on the Rome Statute of the International
Criminal Court, Baden Baden, Nomos, 1999, p. 534.
436 According to Stakić, “[i]f the killing is committed with ’manifest indifference to the value of human
life‘, even conduct of minimal risk can qualify as intentional homicide.“ The Prosecutor v. Milomir
Stakić, Case No. IT-97-24-T, Trial Judgement, 31 July 2003, para. 587
437 For instance, where the suspect is aware of the likelihood that the objective elements of the crime
would occur as a result of his actions or omissions, and in spite of that, takes the risk in the belief that

356. As provided for in article 30(1) of the Statute, the general subjective element
(“intent and knowledge“) therein contemplated applies to any crime within the
jurisdiction of the Court “[u]nless otherwise provided“, that is, as long as the
definition of the relevant crime does not expressly contain a different subjective
element.
357. In this regard, the Chamber observes that the definitions of the war crimes of
conscripting and enlisting children under the age of fifteen years and using them to
participate actively in hostilities set forth in article 8 of the Statute do not contain any
subjective element. However, the Chamber notes that the third element listed in the
Elements of Crimes for these specific crimes requires that, in relation to the age of the
victims, “[t]he perpetrator knew or should have known that such person or persons
were under the age of 15 years.“
358. The “should have known“ requirement set forth in the Elements of Crimes –
which is to be distinguished from the “must have known“ or constructive knowledge
requirement – falls within the concept of negligence because it is met when the
suspect:

his or her expertise will suffice in preventing the realisation of the objective elements of the crime. This
would be the case of a taxi driver taking the risk of driving at a very high speed on a local road,
trusting that nothing would happen on account of his or her driving expertise.
438 The concept of recklessness requires only that the perpetrator be aware of the existence of a risk that
the objective elements of the crime may result from his or her actions or omissions, but does not
require that he or she reconcile himself or herself with the result. In so far as recklessness does not
require the suspect to reconcile himself or herself with the causation of the objective elements of the
crime as a result of his or her actions or omissions, it is not part of the concept of intention. According
to Fletcher, “Recklessness is a form of culpa – equivalent to what German scholars call ‘conscious
negligence’. The problem of distinguishing ‘intention’ and ‘recklessness’ arises because in both cases
the actor is aware that his conduct might generate a specific result.“ FLETCHER, G.P., Rethinking
Criminal Law, New York, Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 443. Hence, recklessness does not meet the
“intent and knowledge“ requirement embodied in article 30 of the Statute. The same conclusion is
reached by ESER, A., “Mental Elements–Mistakes of Fact and Law”, in The Rome Statute of the
International Criminal Court: A Commentary, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2002, Vol. I, pp. 898-899,
and PIRAGOFF, D.K., “Article 30: Mental Element”, in Commentary on the Rome Statute of the
International Criminal Court, Baden Baden, Nomos, 1999, p. 535. Negligence likewise does not meet the
“intent and knowledge“ requirement embodied in article 30 of the Statute.

i. did not know that the victims were under the age of fifteen years at the
time they were enlisted, conscripted or used to participate actively in
hostilities; and
ii. lacked such knowledge because he or she did not act with due diligence in
the relevant circumstances (one can only say that the suspect “should have
known“ if his or her lack of knowledge results from his or her failure to
comply with his or her duty to act with due diligence).439
359. As a result, the “should have known” requirement as provided for in the
Elements of Crimes in relation to articles 8(2)(b)(xxvi) and 8(2)(e)(vii) is an exception
to the “intent and knowledge” requirement embodied in article 30 of the Statute.
Accordingly, as provided for in article 30(1) of the Statute, it will apply in
determining the age of the victims, whereas the general “intent and knowledge”
requirement will apply to the other objective elements of the war crimes set forth in
articles 8(2)(b)(xxvi) and 8(2)(e)(vii) of the Statute, including the existence of an
armed conflict and the nexus between the acts charged and the armed conflict.
360. With respect to the existence of the armed conflict, the Chamber notes that the
Elements of Crimes require only that “[t]he perpetrator was aware of factual
circumstances that established the existence of an armed conflict”, without going as
far as to require that he or she conclude, on the basis of a legal assessment of the said
circumstances, that there was an armed conflict.

439 In this regard, the Chamber takes into account the jurisprudence of the ICTY and ICTR, in which
the conclusion was reached that the expression “had reason to know“ is a stricter requirement than the
“should have known“ requirement because it does not criminalise the military superiors’ lack of due
diligence to comply with their duty to be informed of their subordinates’ activities. According to the
Appeals Chamber of the ad hoc tribunals, the “had reason to know“ requirement embodied in article
7(3) of the ICTY Statute and article 6(3) of the ICTR Statute can be met only if military superiors have,
at the very minimum, specific information available to them alerting them to the need to start an
investigation. The Prosecutor v. Zejnil Delalić et al, Case No. IT-96-21-A, Appeal Judgement, 20 February

ii) The suspect and the other co-perpetrators must all be
mutually aware and mutually accept that implementing
their common plan may result in the realisation of the
objective elements of the crime
361. The theory of co-perpetration based on joint control over the crime requires
two additional subjective elements. The suspect and the other co-perpetrators (a)
must all be mutually aware of the risk that implementing their common plan may
result in the realisation of the objective elements of the crime, and (b) must all
mutually accept such a result by reconciling themselves with it or consenting to it.440
362. The Chamber considers that it is precisely the co-perpetrators’ mutual
awareness and acceptance of this result which justifies (a) that the contributions
made by the others may be attributed to each of them, including the suspect, and (b)
that they be held criminally responsible as principals to the whole crime.
363. As we have seen above, two scenarios must be distinguished. Firstly, if there is
a substantial risk of bringing about the objective elements of the crime (that is, if it is
likely that “it will occur in the ordinary course of events”), the mutual acceptance by
the suspect and the other co-perpetrators of the idea of bringing about the objective
elements of the crime can be inferred from:
i. the awareness by the suspect and the other co-perpetrators of the
substantial likelihood that implementing the common plan would result in
the realisation of the objective elements of the crime; and
ii. the decision by the suspect and the other co-perpetrators to implement the
common plan despite such awareness.
364. Secondly, if the risk of bringing about the objective elements of the crime is
low, the suspect and the other co-perpetrators must have clearly or expressly
accepted the idea that implementing the common plan would result in the realisation
of the objective elements of the crime.

365. Consequently, although, in principle, the war crime of enlisting or
conscripting children under the age of fifteen years or using them to participate
actively in hostilities requires only a showing that the suspect “should have known”
that the victims were under the age of fifteen years, the Chamber considers that this
subjective element is not applicable in the instant case. Indeed, the theory of coperpetration based on joint control over the crime requires that all the coperpetrators, including the suspect, be mutually aware of, and mutually accept, the
likelihood that implementing the common plan would result in the realisation of the
objective elements of the crime.441
iii) The suspect must be aware of the factual circumstances
enabling him or her to jointly control the crime
366. The Chamber considers that the third and last subjective element of coperpetration based on joint control of the crime is the awareness by the suspect of the
factual circumstances enabling him or her to jointly control the crime.442
367. In the view of the Chamber, this requires the suspect to be aware (i) that his or
her role is essential to the implementation of the common plan, and hence in the
commission of the crime, and (ii) that he or she can – by reason of the essential nature
of his or her task – frustrate the implementation of the common plan, and hence the
commission of the crime, by refusing to perform the task assigned to him or her.

441 Had the Prosecution alleged, for instance, that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo committed the abovementioned crimes himself – as opposed to jointly with others – the “should have known“ requirement
would have been applicable in relation to determining the age of the victims.
442 In the Stakić Trial Judgement, the Trial Chamber referred to this element: “Dr. Stakić’s awareness of
the importance of his own role“, The Prosecutor v. Milomir Stakić, Case No. IT-97-24-T, Trial Judgement,

B. Is there sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe
that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo is criminally responsible as a co-perpetrator
within the meaning of article 25(3)(a) of the Statute for the crimes with
which he is charged?
1. Objective Elements
a. Existence of an agreement or common plan between two or
more persons
368. Firstly, the Chamber finds that there is sufficient evidence to establish
substantial grounds to believe that, from early September 2002 to the end of 2003,
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo:
i. served as de jure President of the Union des Patriotes Congolais pour la
Reconciliation et la Paix (UPC/RP);443
ii. appointed444, dismissed445 and expelled446 UPC/RP National Secretaries; and

443 According to [REDACTED], in early September 2002, “[b]efore the members of the executive were
appointed, a consensus was reached that Thomas LUBANGA be appointed president of the
movement. Although this move was not wholly consistent with our movement’s constitution – in that
an election ought really to have been held – everyone agreed that he be appointed.“ ([REDACTED],
para. 128). Thomas Lubanga Dyilo signed a number of decrees and declarations as UPC/RP President
and specifically i) Decree No. 002/UPC/RP/CAB/PRES/2002, signed in Bunia on 3 September 2002; see
the transcript of the interview with [REDACTED], DRC-D01-0002-0045, para. 135; (ii) Decree No.
013/UPC/RP/CAB/PRES/2002 of 30 October 2002, signed in Bunia on 30 October 2002 (DRC-D01-0001-
0023 and DRC-D01-0001-0024); (iii) Decree No. 08bis/UPC/RP/CAB/PRESS/2003, signed in Kinshasa on
8 December 2003 (DRC-OTP-0132-0237); (iv) Official Declaration No. UPC-RP/02/2002 signed in Bunia
on 14 September 2002 (DRC-D01-0001-0019 to DRC-D01-0001-0021); and (v) Official Declaration No.
UPC-RP/03/2002, signed by Thomas Lubanga Dyilo in Bunia on 14 September 2002 (DRC-D01-0001-
0022).
444 See the transcript of the interview with [REDACTED], paras. 126-130. [REDACTED] describes the
appointment of these members as follows: “Once the movement’s name had been definitively
adopted, [REDACTED] to work on the composition of our movement’s first executive. […] The
negotiations had already begun [REDACTED]. Some people had already put themselves forward as
candidates: the president himself oversaw this. [REDACTED]. At the time, Thomas LUBANGA was
not sure [REDACTED]. I believe that the UPC executive was promulgated by President LUBANGA’s
second official decree. Decrees are documents prepared by the office of the president that the
president himself signs.“ ([REDACTED], paras. 127, 129 and 130).
445 See the transcript of the interview [REDACTED], paras. 135 and 136. [REDACTED] explains why
the reshuffle was carried out and, in [REDACTED] opinion, only Thomas Lubanga Dyilo knows why
such senior members of the executive, like Adèle Lotsove for example, the former Governor of Ituri,
were replaced ([REDACTED], paras. 135 and 136). See also Decree No. 08bis/UPC/RP/CAB/PRES/2003
(DRC-OTP-0132-0237) signed by Thomas Lubanga Dyilo in Kinshasa, on 8 December 2003, which
ICC-01/04-01/06-803-tEN 14-05-2007 125/157 SL PT

Official Court Translation
iii. had de facto ultimate control over the adoption and implementation of
UPC/RP policies, and only received technical advice from the movement’s
National Secretaries.447
369. As for the months of July and August 2002, although [REDACTED] claims to
have heard that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was in direct contact with the UPC political
and military leadership in Bunia in early August 2002, when UPDF and UPC forces
attacked APC troops in Bunia,448 [REDACTED]– states that:
a. [REDACTED] Thomas Lubanga Dyilo [REDACTED] communicate with
the outside or to receive visits;449
b. it was after [REDACTED] learnt that the UPC had taken control of Bunia
that [REDACTED] issued the Déclaration Politique du Front pour la
Réconciliation et la Paix.
450
370. Therefore, on the evidence admitted for the purpose of the confirmation
hearing, there is insufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that
before his release at the end of August 2002451 and his appointment as President of

suspended Daniel Litscha, Victor Ngona Kabarole and Floribert Kisembo, among others, from their
duties.
446 See, for example, Decree No. 016/UPC/RP/CAB/PRESS/2002 (DRC-OTP-0089-0057), signed by
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo in Bunia, on 2 December 2002, in which Chief Kahwa who, at the time, was
Deputy National Secretary for Defence, was expelled from the UPC/RP.
447 According to [REDACTED], some UPC/RP politicians, in particular Daniel Litsha, were
disappointed because Thomas Lubanga Dyilo did not follow the strategies agreed upon in their
meetings ([REDACTED], lines 299-306). [REDACTED] states that according to [REDACTED], Lubanga
took most of the decisions without consulting with the members of the UPC/RP executive and ran the
UPC/RP like a dictator and was against any dialogue within the movement (DRC-OTP-0105-0111,
paras. 144 and 145). Kristine Peduto testified that not only did the UPC recognise Lubanga as its
leader, but the UPC was also widely perceived as being under his control (ICC-01-04-01-06-T-38-
EN[20Nov2006Corrected], page 49, lines 5-9).

the UPC/RP in early September 2002,452 Thomas Lubanga Dyilo had ultimate de facto
control over the adoption and implementation of UPC/RP policies.
371. Regarding the period from 13 August 2003 to the end of 2003, although the
DRC authorities claim to have detained Thomas Lubanga Dyilo on 13 August 2003
and kept him under house arrest in Kinshasa until the end of 2003,453 it should be
noted that:
a. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo is the first signatory of the “Projet de Société” issued
by the UPC/RP in Bunia on 15 November 2003;454
b. there is evidence that it was the dispute between Thomas Lubanga Dyilo,
on the one hand, and Daniel Litsha455, Victor Ngona Kabarole456 and
Floribert Kisembo,457 on the other hand, which led to their being suspended
from their official duties by a decree signed by Thomas Lubanga Dyilo in
Kinshasa on 8 December 2003.458
372. Having given special consideration to this evidence, the Chamber finds that
there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that, despite
being under house arrest in Kinshasa at the time, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo continued,
from 13 August 2003 to the end of 2003, to exercise de facto within the UPC/RP the
powers that he had exercised since the beginning of September 2002.

373. There is also sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was appointed FPLC Commander-in-Chief immediately after
the creation of the FPLC as the military wing of the UPC/RP in early September
2002,459 and that, from early September 2002 to the end of 2003, Thomas Lubanga
Dyilo:
i. served in that position de jure;
460
ii. was regularly briefed about the general situation in Ituri and, in particular,
about FPLC military operations and the situation in the FPLC military
training camps;461 and
iii. de facto regularly performed the duties associated with the position of
Commander-in-Chief of the FPLC, which he held de jure.

purpose of the confirmation hearing suggests that other officers in the FPLC General

460 Throughout his interview with the Prosecution, [REDACTED] refers to Thomas Lubanga Dyilo as
the “Supreme Commander“ (see, for example, [REDACTED], lines 1315 and 1316, [REDACTED], line
1324 and [REDACTED], lines 2548-2550). [REDACTED] together with the other members of
[REDACTED] were appointed by Thomas Lubanga Dyilo ([REDACTED], lines 2294-2300).
[REDACTED].
461 [REDACTED] says that [REDACTED] often went to see Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, amongst other
reasons, to discuss logistic and financial issues ([REDACTED], line 2366 to [REDACTED], line 2379
and DRC-[REDACTED], lines 2559-2573); Statement of [REDACTED] (DRC-OTP-0127-0084, para. 65
and DRC-OTP-0127-0087, para. 81). [REDACTED] also refers to the close ties between Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo and Rafiki Saba and Bosco Ntaganda ([REDACTED], lines 109-112 and [REDACTED],
lines 113-127). [REDACTED] explains that Daniel Litsha told him about the close ties between Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo, Bosco Ntaganda and Rafiki Saba (DRC-OTP-0105-0111, para. 144). [REDACTED]
states that Bosco Ntaganda used a Motorola to communicate with Thomas Lubanga, Chief Kahwa and
Floribert Kisembo (DRC-OTP-0127-0082, para. 55). More specifically, [REDACTED] noted that Bosco
Ntaganda was in regular contact with Thomas Lubanga. “I believe he would contact him at least once
a day and brief him on the situation and how the training was going.“ (DRC-OTP-0127-0082, para. 56).
[REDACTED] also describes the daily contact between Bosco Ntaganda and Rafiki Saba (DRC-OTP0127-0091, para. 102).

Staff and, in particular, Floribert Kisembo, could have ordered the launching of
military operations without consulting Thomas Lubanga Dyilo.463
375. [REDACTED] himself refers to:
a. the divisions among FPLC military officers as a result of the conflict
between Thomas Lubanga Dyilo and Chief Kahwa between September and
early December 2002;464
b. the crisis within the FPLC following the departure in late January 2003 of
Commander Jérôme, FPLC Commander for the North-East Sector at the
time;465 and
c. the fact that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo worked more with FPLC Deputy
Chief of Staff, Bosco Ntaganda, and UPC Chief of Security, Rafiki Saba.466
376. Consequently, on the evidence admitted for the purpose of the confirmation
hearing, there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that, in
the main, but not on a permanent basis, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo had the final say
over the adoption of FPLC policies and the implementation by the FPLC of policies
adopted either by the UPC/RP or the FPLC.

463 For example, [REDACTED] says that the launch of the military operations which he refers to in
paragraph 124 of his statement was decided and planned by Floribert Kisembo, Bosco Ntaganda,
Tchaligonza, Kasangaki, and Bagonza (DRC-OTP-0105-0107, paras. 123 and 124). He added: “I clearly
remember KAHWA [REDACTED] most of the crimes committed by the UPC during attacks were
KISEMBO’s doing. [REDACTED] that KISEMBO decided on some attacks without even referring back
to LUBANGA. KAHWA used the expression “hard-hearted” to describe KISEMBO. By that he meant
that KISEMBO was merciless. [REDACTED] that KISEMBO’s attitude came from having spent too
much time with Bosco NTAGANDA. KYALIGONZA [REDACTED] that KISEMBO had a tough and
merciless nature.“, DRC-OTP-0105-0119, para. 182. Furthermore, according to Floribert Kisembo,
“Thomas Lubanga had not trained these soldiers… to be his soldiers… It was a consequence of the
policy… which was not working… Which resulted in the fact that… these soldiers were there… but he
did not like… he himself did not have control over his soldiers… He had no control over his soldiers…

377. There is also sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe
that:
i. when the FPLC was established in early September 2002, there was an
agreement or common plan between Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, Chief Kahwa
Panga Mandro (UPC Deputy National Secretary for Defence),
467 Rafiki Saba
(UPC Chief of Security),468 Floribert Kisembo (FPLC Chief of Staff),469 Bosco
Ntaganda (FPLC Deputy Chief of Staff for Military Operations),470 and
other FPLC senior commanders, including Commander Tchalingonza, who
was in charge of the South-East Sector471 to further the UPC/RP and FPLC
war effort by (i) recruiting, voluntarily or forcibly, young people into the
FPLC; (ii) subjecting them to military training and (iii) using them to
participate actively in military operations and as bodyguards;
ii. although the agreement or common plan did not specifically target
children under the age of fifteen years – it did target young recruits in
general – in the normal course of events, its implementation entailed the
objective risk that it would involve children under the age of fifteen years;
and

467 According to [REDACTED], Chief Kahwa Panga Mandro, who was below Thomas Lubanga Dyilo
in the chain of command, [REDACTED] ([REDACTED], lines 1313-1333), started having problems
with Thomas Lubanga Dyilo in mid-October 2002 ([REDACTED], lines 2421-2425) and sometime
before the end of 2002, had left the UPC/RP and founded his own movement, PUSIC ([REDACTED],
lines 1313-1335). In this regard, see Decree No. 016/UPC/RP/CAB/PRES/ 2002 (DRC-OTP-0089-0057),
signed by Thomas Lubanga Dyilo in Bunia, on 2 December 2002, dismissing Chief Kahwa who, at the
time, was Deputy National Secretary for Defence, from the UPC/RP.
468 [REDACTED] says that Rafiki Saba was UPC/RP Chief of Security at the time ([REDACTED],
lines 115 and 116). [REDACTED] ([REDACTED], lines 109-112 and [REDACTED], lines 113-127) and
[REDACTED] (DRC-OTP-0105-0111, para. 144) both refer to the close ties between Thomas Lubanga
Dyilo, Rafiki Saba and Bosco Ntaganda.
469 According to [REDACTED] from its inception until 3 December 2003 ([REDACTED], line 1195 to
[REDACTED], line 1310). See also Decree No. 08bis/UPC/RP/CAB/PRES/2003 (DRC-OTP-0132-0237),
signed by Thomas Lubanga Dyilo in Kinshasa, on 8 December 2003, in which Floribert Kisembo is
suspended from his duties as FPLC Chief of Staff and replaced by Bosco Ntaganda.
470 According to [REDACTED], Bosco Ntaganda was the FPLC Deputy Chief of Staff for Military
Operations until [REDACTED] 8 December 2003 ([REDACTED], lines 1608-1616 and [REDACTED],
lines 2659-2661). See also Decree No. 08bis/UPC/RP/CAB/PRES/2003 (DRC-OTP-0132-0237).

iii. the implementation of the agreement or common plan started at the latest
when the FPLC was founded, i.e. in early September 2002, and lasted at
least until the end of 2003.472
378. In this regard, the Chamber finds that there is sufficient evidence to establish
substantial grounds to believe that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, Chief Kahwa, Rafiki
Saba, Floribert Kisembo, Bosco Ntaganda and Tchalingonza knew each other and
had worked together well before the creation of the FPLC. This conclusion follows
from the fact that there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to
believe that:
a. the above-named persons were in one way or another involved in the July
2000 Hema mutiny within the APC, which triggered the creation of the
UPC;473
b. they subsequently underwent military training at the Jinja military camp in
Uganda;474
c. in early 2001, all these persons, except Thomas Lubanga, Chief Kahwa and
Rafiki Saba, were military personnel assigned to the Simba Battalion
deployed to the Équatoriale Province as members of the FLC;475

472 The Chamber has already found in Section IV/ B. that there is sufficient evidence to establish
substantial grounds to believe that voluntary and forcible recruitment of young recruits, including
those under the age of fifteen years, and their active participation in military operations and as
bodyguards, continued throughout this period, although there is evidence that the FPLC allegedly lost
control of a number of its military training camps at various times. See, for example, para. 185 above,
concerning the FPLC’s loss of control of the Mandro training camp at the beginning of December 2002,
after Chief Kahwa left the UPC/RP and founded PUSIC. See also para. 185 above, concerning the
FPLC’s loss of control over a number of its military training camps close to Bunia, in particular, the
Rwampara Camp, after the withdrawal of the FPLC from Bunia on 6 March 2003, following the joint
UPDF-FNI attack on Bunia, until the FPLC regained control of Bunia in early May 2003, following the
withdrawal of the UPDF forces stationed in Bunia.

d. after the split within the FLC, they were redeployed to Bunia as members
of the APC and worked alongside Thomas Lubanga Dyilo insofar as the
latter was Defence Minister in the RCD-K/ML Government;476
e. after the UPC withdrew from the RCD-K/ML Government on 17 April
2002, they formed the core of the UPC military wing, which formally
became the FPLC by a decree dated early September 2000 and signed by
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo;477
f. from early September 2002: a) military matters were handled by Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo and Chief Kahwa, UPC/RP Deputy National Secretary for
Defence, directly with FPLC military commanders and, after the departure
of Chief Kahwa from the UPC/RP, such matters came under the exclusive
remit of the office of the President of the UPC/RP478, and b) Rafiki Saba, as
UPC/RP Chief of Security, was also involved in such matters.479

Chamber has concluded that it existed and has made findings as to the content
thereof having found that there was sufficient evidence to establish substantial
grounds to believe that from early September 2002 to the end of 2003:
i. the FPLC repeatedly admitted into its ranks young recruits, including
children under the age of fifteen years, who wished to voluntarily join
the FPLC;480
ii. the FPLC repeatedly forcibly recruited into its ranks young recruits,
including children under the age of fifteen years;481

487 During his visits to the training camps, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo saw young FPLC recruits, including
recruits under the age of fifteen years, undergoing training. He spoke to them and encouraged them to
fight. The Statements [REDACTED] (DRC-OTP-0108-0129, para. 30), [REDACTED] (DRC-OTP-0126-
0129, para. 34) and [REDACTED] (DRC-OTP-0126-0158, para. 23) describe Thomas Lubanga Dyilo’s
visits to the training camps at Centrale, Rwampara and Irumu, sometime before early September 2002
and 13 August 2003, when young FPLC recruits, including those under the age of fifteen years, were
beginning their military training. The video recording of Thomas Lubanga’s visit to the Rwampara
Camp on 12 February 2003 and the transcript of the speech he gave before the young FPLC recruits,
including those under the age of fifteen years, shows that he encouraged them to complete their
military training and to prepare to take part in military operations (DRC-OTP-0120-0342, line 131 and
DRC-OTP-0120-0349, line 329).
488 [REDACTED] said that when he could he would attend the parades held to mark the end of the
military training for young FPLC recruits ([REDACTED], line 377 to [REDACTED], line 396). In
addition, [REDACTED] notes that during his stay at the [REDACTED] military training camp,

training camps where young recruits, including those under the age of
fifteen years, were being trained;
viii. upon completion of their military training, Floribert Kisembo490 and
Bosco Ntaganda491 and other senior commanders (such as
Tchalingonza)492 provided the young recruits, including those under the
age of fifteen years, with a military uniform and a personal weapon
(usually a firearm), and soon thereafter ordered them into combat on the
front line in military operations conducted in Libi and Mbau in October
2002, in Largu in early 2003, in Lipri and Bogoro in February and March
2003, in Bunia in May 2003 and in Djugu and Mongwalu in June 2003;493
ix. it was common practice494 among the most senior FPLC commanders (i.e.
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo495, Floribert Kisembo496 and Bosco Ntaganda497)

[REDACTED], in addition to Bosco Ntaganda who, at the time, was responsible for military training,
he also saw Rafiki Saba, Floribert Kisembo and Tchalingonza (DRC-OTP-0127-0081, para. 50).
489 According to [REDACTED], Bosco Ntaganda had direct responsibility for training the young FPLC
recruits and [REDACTED], Bosco Ntaganda would address the recruits at the parades held to mark
the end of their military training ([REDACTED], line 1195 and [REDACTED], lines 398 and 399). Bosco
Ntaganda also appears on video recording DRC-OTP-0120-0293 (minute 00:03:10), which proves that
he was at the Rwampara Camp when Thomas Lubanga Dyilo visited it on 12 February 2003.

495 Kristine Peduto testified that during her visit on 30 May 2003 to Thomas Lubanga Dyilo’s residence
in the Mudzi Pela neighbourhood (in Bunia), she saw a child, whose physical appearance clearly
showed that he was under the age of fifteen years, who was guarding the residence, in uniform and
bearing a Kalashnikov rifle (ICC-04-01-01-06-T-37-EN[15Nov2006Edited], p. 99, line 24 to p. 101, line
17). When cross-examined by the Defence, witness Peduto repeated what she had said in her
examination-in-chief (ICC-04-01-01-06-T-39-EN[21Nov2006Edited], p. 98, line 3 to p. 100, line 6).
496 [REDACTED] says that [REDACTED] had to wait, sometimes with the bodyguards of
[REDACTED], who included child soldiers (DRC-OTP-0132-0087, para. 39). Furthermore, according to
ICC-01/04-01/06-803-tEN 14-05-2007 134/157 SL PT

and other senior commanders (such as Tchalingonza498) to use young
recruits, including those under the age of fifteen years, as bodyguards to
protect military objectives, such as their physical safety (including
during military operations) and FPLC military quarters.
380. The conclusion reached by the Chamber as to the existence, content, and
timeframe of the common plan is no way undermined by the statement of
[REDACTED], who works for [REDACTED] in Bunia, and according to whom:
i. the problem of child soldiers in Bunia only surfaced after the UPDF and
the FNI retook control of Bunia from the UPC on 6 March 2003 – which
until then had been in the hands of the UPC;499 and
ii. upon the UPC’s and Thomas Lubanga Dyilo’s return to Bunia in early
May 2003, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo encouraged the demobilisation of
child soldiers from all armed groups active in Ituri, including the
FPLC.500
381. In this regard, the Chamber notes that this statement is at odds with several
pieces of evidence admitted for the purpose of the confirmation hearing.501 The

[REDACTED], Floribert Kisembo and Bosco Ntaganda “were always escorted by three or four
bodyguards each. Their escorts were adult militia members and young people my age.“ (DRC-OTP0114-0021, para. 31).
497 Regarding [REDACTED], [REDACTED] says that “[a]fter giving these specific instructions to his
men, he turned towards us, the young recruits, and chose [REDACTED], including myself, and
[REDACTED] militiamen over the age of eighteen to join his own escort. One of the [REDACTED] was
my age, while [REDACTED] was younger. […] From that day until I left the UPC militia, I followed
my commander everywhere he went, as my new duties required.“ (DRC-OTP-0126-0134, para. 52).
[REDACTED] said that it was [REDACTED] responsibility as [REDACTED] bodyguard to follow
[REDACTED] to collect [REDACTED] weapons and bring them back to Bunia (DRC-OTP-0126-0136,
para. 58 to DRC-OTP-0126-0137, para. 61), to guard [REDACTED] house as the hostilities were about
to begin and to participate directly in combat when ordered to do so (DRC-OTP-0126-0138, paras. 63
and 64); see also [REDACTED] (DRC-OTP-0114-0021, para. 31); [REDACTED] (DRC-OTP-0132-0087,
para. 39).
498 [REDACTED] asserts that [REDACTED] had [REDACTED] young FPLC soldiers as bodyguards,
some of whom were under the age of fifteen years ([REDACTED], (DRC-OTP-0126-0159, para. 26).

Chamber has given special consideration to [REDACTED] statement regarding the
extent to which the Child Demobilisation Decree signed on 1 June 2003 by Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo was implemented,502 and to the Circular503 signed on 5 June 2003 by
Floribert Kisembo ordering all FPLC units to implement the said decree. According
to [REDACTED] “[t]his order has not been executed.”504
382. In addition, the Chamber recalls that when she was asked about the Child
Demobilisation Decree of 1 June 2003, Kristine Peduto answered that she thought it
was “a public relations operation.”505
b. Co-ordinated essential contribution by each co-perpetrator
resulting in the realisation of the objective elements of the

383. The Chamber finds that there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial
grounds to believe that from the time the FPLC was established in early September

children had enlisted in the RCD/K-ML’s APC because they had nowhere to go: most of them were
orphans.“ ([REDACTED], para. 183). Similarly, [REDACTED] also believes that the children started to
join Hema militia groups during the last six months of 2000. Furthermore, [REDACTED], para. 184)
both refer in their statements to the training of young Hemas at the Mandro Camp as from June or
July 2002 (DRC-OTP-0105-0105, paras. 115 and 116) and to the fact that “[w]hen the UPC drove out
Lopondo [in early August 2002], the children joined the UPC army and fought for the FPLC“ (DRCOTP-0105-0099, para. 80).

the implementation of the plan, including:

506 See footnote 267.
507 Regarding Chief Kahwa Panga Mandro, [REDACTED] stated that the Department of Defence was
in charge of the training of new recruits ([REDACTED], lines 84-87), and identifies Chief Kahwa as
UPC Defence Minister up to the beginning of December 2002 ([REDACTED], lines 2421-2425 and
[REDACTED], lines 419-432). In this respect, [REDACTED] para. 137 and [REDACTED], para. 153)
explains that i) in the first UPC/RP executive, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo delegated responsibility to Chief
Kahwa Panga Mandro, Deputy National Secretary for Defence, for dealing with defence-related
issues, and that ii) the Office of the President performed this role after Chief Kahwa’s post was
abolished by Decree No. 018/UPC/RP/CAB/PRES/2002 of 11 December 2002. Furthermore,
[REDACTED] says that after Chief Kahwa returned from his mission to Rwanda, “he held discussions
with the UPC’s other Hema militiamen and the Hema dignitaries in order to locate a site where the
military training could be conducted. The traditional chiefs were afraid and so Chief KAHWA offered
MANDRO as the UPC’s first military training centre. With the site agreed upon, the Hema traditional
chiefs sent their young people to MANDRO to undergo military training […] Chief KAHWA
[REDACTED] that initially he was the one who welcomed the young Hemas to the MANDRO training
camp. Bosco NTAGANDA joined him at the camp and helped train the troops.“ (DRC-OTP-0105-0105,
paras. 115 and 116).
[REDACTED] describes the importance of Rafiki Saba within the UPC/RP and FPLC as a result of his
close ties with Thomas Lubanga Dyilo and Bosco Ntangada ([REDACTED], lines 109-112, and
[REDACTED], lines 113-127); in this regard, see also the Statement of [REDACTED] (DRC-OTP-0105-
0111, para. 144). [REDACTED] also says that [REDACTED] in June/July 2002, in addition to Bosco
Ntaganda, who was responsible for military training at the time, he also saw Rafiki Saba, Kisembo and
Tchalingonza, amongst others, at the camp (DRC-OTP-0127-0181, para. 50).
Regarding [REDACTED], he states that parades were held to mark the end of the military training for
young FPLC recruits and that, [REDACTED] generally attended the parades to address the recruits, to
boost their morale and advise them on their military role ([REDACTED], lines 377-390 and
[REDACTED], lines 393-396). In addition, regarding [REDACTED] use of children under the age of
fifteen years as bodyguards, see footnote 496.
[REDACTED] describes the importance of Bosco Ntaganda within the FPLC, and his close ties with
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo and Rafiki Saba ([REDACTED], lines 109-112 and [REDACTED], lines 113-
127); in this regard, see also the Statement of [REDACTED] ([REDACTED], para. 144). Also, according
to [REDACTED], Bosco Ntaganda had direct responsibility for training and [REDACTED], Bosco
Ntaganda would address the young FPLC recruits at the parades held to mark the end of their
military training ([REDACTED], lines 398 and 399). According to [REDACTED], Bosco Ntaganda was
in charge of military training at the Mandro Camp in June/July 2002 (DRC-OTP-0127-0181, para. 50).
Video recording DRC-OTP-0120-0293 shows Bosco Ntaganda during Thomas Lubanga Dyilo’s visit to
the Rwampara Camp on 12 February 2003. When Thomas Lubanga Dyilo asked them if Bosco
Ntaganda had visited the camp, the young FPLC recruits, including those under the age of fifteen
years, answered in the affirmative (DRC-OTP-0120-0343, lines 179-182 and DRC-OTP-0120-0344,
lines 183-185). Furthermore, these recruits were clearly told, including those under the age of fifteen
years, that they should discuss any problems they may have with Bosco Ntaganda because he would
then inform the upper echelons of the hierarchy (DRC-OTP-0120-0351, lines 386-391). See also the

Mungwalu by the UPC in February 2003 […] On the road to the Mungwalu market
where he was visiting his family, [REDACTED] was taken in a vehicle in which
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was travelling with 6 other soldiers. [REDACTED] was
with his older brother who was able to flee. Other children were caught, three of
them were older, the others were younger: [REDACTED], four from Mungwalu,
the others from Bunia. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo told them that they would go as far
as Beni and that they would become rich […] They were all taken to Mandro where
there were a lot of soldiers. They were organised into groups of 20, with
Commander Fiston, Gegere, as their instructor. They received one week of training
during which they learned how to handle GPMG weapons, rocket launchers and
“rapides”. They ate beans and maize with difficulty. He was then sent to a small
village to provide security with about 30 other persons. After 6 March, he remained
in the bush for a week before returning to his father’s home in Bunia.514
386. After stating that while he was undergoing his military training at the
[REDACTED] Camp at the beginning of 2003,515 other children under the age of
fifteen years were also undergoing the same training at the camp, [REDACTED]
asserted that:
From what I was told by the other militiamen, the President periodically visited the
training camps to speak to the new recruits.516
387. [REDACTED] also provided the following information about the specific
protocol they learnt at the [REDACTED] Camp for Thomas Lubanga Dyilo’s visits:
A while after we had begun our military training, some other militiamen came to
the camp to teach us the protocol for visits by superiors. If President LUBANGA
came you had to lift your rifle by holding the butt in your hand and resting the
barrel on your shoulder, and then march past him with your legs very straight.517

having them leave these armed groups. Based on these experiences we felt that we would be better
armed to respond, and also by taking notes we could have a memory record of the questions which
we had put and not have to put the same questions several times over, and to have a basis on which to
work with them on an individual basis in the future. Excuse me. Also, in my specific role at MONUC
the objective was to document and to archive information on the recruitment and utilisation of
children by various armed groups, so the idea was to document what was happening as to prepare the
response which one might have to give these children.“ (ICC-04-01-01-06-T-37-EN[15Nov2006Edited],
p. 79, line 14 to p. 80, line 7).

Christine Peduto confirmed the information she had provided under examination by the Prosecution
(ICC-04-01-01-06-T-39-EN[21Nov2006Edited], p. 74, line 25 to p. 76, line 12).
515 In his statement, [REDACTED] says that he was forcibly taken to the FPLC training camp in
[REDACTED] “[o]ne day in early 2003“ (DRC-OTP-0108-0126, para. 19 and DRC-OTP-0108-0127, para.

388. [REDACTED] also described one of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo’s visits to the
[REDACTED]Camp while it was under FPLC control:518
I remember that President LUBANGA once came to visit us at the military camp
during our training and that he told us that we had to fully understand what our
instructors taught us so that we could attack and annihilate “those who wanted to
play with us”. I think that by this he meant the Lendu fighters.519
389. After equally stating that while [REDACTED] was undergoing her military
training at the [REDACTED] Camp, other children under the age of fifteen years
were also undergoing the same training at the camp,520 [REDACTED] also described
one of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo’s visits to the [REDACTED] Camp while it was under
FPLC control as follows:521
We already knew Commander BOSCO because during our military training he
visited [REDACTED] camp twice. The first time he spoke to us saying that we
had better not run away from the camp or we would be killed and that we should
make every effort to reach the end of our training because it was for our future
well-being. The second time was two weeks before the end of our training, but he
did not address us because he was just accompanying the UPC president, Thomas
LUBANGA, with whom he had arrived. Each of them was in his own jeep.
LUBANGA encouraged us to withstand the difficulties of the training until the end
because it was to free our country from the Ugandans and the Lendu. He spoke to
us in Swahili. He added that it was not the responsibility of others to make the
Congo free, but our own. I would not be able to say who LUBANGA was referring
to by “others”. At the end of his speech, LUBANGA asked if anyone had any
questions, but the threatening look that Commander [REDACTED] turned
towards us made us understand that there were none, so no one dared speak and
he departed in his jeep followed by BOSCO’s jeep.522

518 [REDACTED] stated that his military training started in early 2003 (DRC-OTP-0108-0126, para. 19)
and ended at least 15 to 30 days before the FPLC attack on Lipri (DRC-OTP-0108-0131, para. 42)
which, as indicated above, was carried out between the end of February and early March 2003. So
Lubanga’s visit to [REDACTED] Camp mentioned by [REDACTED] took place before the FPLC
withdrew from Bunia in early March 2003, after the joint UPDF and FNI attack on Bunia.

520 Statement of [REDACTED] (DRC-OTP-0126-0126, paras. 23 and 24).
521 [REDACTED] stated that she was forced to go to the [REDACTED] Camp while she was fleeing
Bunia after the UPC offensive against APC troops in Bunia, which caused Governor Jean-Pierre
Lopondo to flee and which occurred in early August 2002 (DRC-OTP-0126-0126, paras. 22-24); that
training at the [REDACTED] Camp lasted between one and a half months and two months (DRCOTP-0126-0128, para. 31 and DRC-OTP-0126-0129, para. 33); and that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo visited
[REDACTED]Camp about two weeks before the end of the training (DRC-OTP-0126-0129, para. 34).

390. After stating that while she was undergoing her military training at the
[REDACTED] Camp in 2003, other children under the age of fifteen years were also
undergoing the same training at the camp,523 [REDACTED] recalled two of Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo’s visits to the camp while it was under FPLC control:524
[h]e visited the camp at least twice during my military training in Centrale but I
was unable to attend his visits because each time I was sent shopping in the village
market and therefore missed him. According to what the other recruits told me on
my return to camp, upon his arrival LUBANGA only spoke to the camp
commanders and not to the young fighters who were there for training. The other
militia members also said that the aim of the meetings was to give commanders
instructions on how to improve the way the camp was run and motivate them in
their activities.525
391. Video number DRC-OTP-0120-0293 features Thomas Lubanga Dyilo visiting
the Rwampara Camp on 12 February 2003 and, in his speech, he encourages young
FPLC recruits, including those under the age of fifteen years, to participate in
hostilities. He was preparing them in this regard when he stated:
What we are doing, and we are doing it together with you, is to build an army …
that can prevent … the killings … for all the tribes that are here in Ituri. Our army
does not have one tribal enemy, no … the Bira tribe is not the enemy of our army,
nor the Lendu tribe, nor the Hema tribe. Our enemy is any person… who refuses to
allow peace to return to us here. Do we agree?526
“[…] I wish you …. good training, do it, persevere, and tomorrow you will stand
with a weapon and a uniform and the citizens will recognize you that now we have
gotten protectors… We travelled some time before, we… returned recently … This
army that we are protecting here is not a joke. It is an important army… I think
that, in a few days from now, some among you who studied … who will finish the
training, we … they will continue with other training, hey? They should continue
to grow”.527
“[…] It should be a worthy army that we will present to the people. And already,
the work that our army is doing now is of value to us all… When you finish, others
will come behind you … we are forming this army and everybody feels …. “I am a
useful soldier”… You stand facing the his… hi.. history of the country and you

523 Statement of [REDACTED] (DRC-OTP-0126-0158, para. 21 and DRC-OTP-0126-0159, para. 22.
524 According to [REDACTED], Lubanga visited the [REDACTED] Camp in 2003 while [REDACTED]
was undergoing military training (DRC-OTP-0126-0158, para. 23) and sometime before [REDACTED]
participated in FPLC military operations in Lipri at the end of [REDACTED] military training (DRCOTP-0126-0161, para. 32). Moreover, the FPLC military operations in Lipri took place in February and
in early March 2003, i.e. before and around the time of the FPLC’s retreat from Bunia in March 2006 as
a result of a joint UPDF-FNI attack (see para. 184 above).

392. In her testimony, Kristine Peduto explained as follows what she had heard
about the instructions given by Thomas Lubanga Dyilo and the UPC/RP leadership
to mobilise the Hema community in a bid to intensify its war effort:
Q: Did you hear or did you get to know as to whether Thomas Lubanga
participated in such sort of public calls to the Hema community?
A: This is something that was reported to us, but – which I did not hear myself.
Q: What have you – what has been reported to you in respect of Thomas Lubanga
Dyilo?
A: That orders had been sent to the superiors of the UPC – to UPC officials, to
ensure that recruitments took place.
Q: And can you provide some detail on what these orders were about in more
concrete terms?
A: The orders were to mobilise and make sure that the Hema community
mobilised to defend itself against attacks from Lendu militias. When we refer
to the Hema community, we are referring here to all the population with
messages as clear as calls to families to give up one of their children. There
was one of the messages – one of the clearest messages which was given to the
families, which was that they should contribute to the struggle of the
movement of the party, either giving a child a cow, or sometimes these
requests were for material support of the child while the child was a member
of the movement. This was a recurrent message within the Hema community.
Q: And how did you get to know about this recurrent message within the Hema
community?
A: By many various testimonies from various sources, either from informers or
from people who were in charge of protecting children. It was mostly the
protection agencies that told us about us – but there were also people that we
met in the course of our general investigations, which were – who were not
involved in the politics as pursued by one or other of the groups. They told us
this on many occasions. This seemed to be the order of the day for a large
number of people in the areas that were under UPC control.”529
393. Kristine Peduto also explained that she met Thomas Lubanga Dyilo in person
for the first time during a meeting held on 30 May 2003 at his residence in Mudzi-

Pela, a neighbourhood of Bunia.530 When asked whether Thomas Lubanga Dyilo’s
residence was guarded at the time of the meeting, Kristine Peduto stated the
following:
A. Yes, it was guarded and I remember especially because this is something that
really shocked us. It was guarded by children – armed children – not only
armed children, but including armed children, and they were wearing
uniforms.
Q. And these armed children wearing uniforms, just for clarification, were
guarding the residence of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo? This is a question.
A. Yes, that’s right, exactly; they were guarding this residence and it was obvious
in the way in which they approached the vehicles of MONUC that parked in
the compound of that residence and who took part in effecting our entry into
the residence of Mr Lubanga.
Q. And do you still, Ms Peduto – do you still have a recollection about the age of
these children?
A. I thought that they were young enough to – for all of us to be shocked at their
presence during our arrival. I remember seeing one who was particularly
small, but at the same time, it was nearly nightfall, so we did not carry out a
detailed investigation on the membership of the guard. We were particularly
shocked by their presence and I saw – I remember seeing a young child who
was less than 15 years of age, obviously. I didn’t really take note of the other
ones.
Q. You mentioned that these children, including the one child in respect of which
you were sure that it was under 15 years, that these children were armed.
What sort of arms did they have?
A. I think they had Kalashnikovs.
Q. And how did you feel at the time when you went to Thomas Lubanga Dyilo
with the purpose to talk about the use of children in the UPC militia and you
arrived at his residence and you saw children, including young children,
guarding his residence?
A. We thought it was somewhat provocative, especially as the MONUC officer
was going to the meeting, whereas, in my view, the interview should have
been conducted in MONUC. The MONUC field office manager was courteous
enough to go to the place of the meeting and I felt that this episode was a
provocation of some sort by Mr Lubanga.
Q: [Not interpreted]
A: By Mr Lubanga.531

voluntary and forcible recruitment of children under the age of fifteen years into

FPLC ranks and using them to participate actively in hostilities covers the period
from 1 July 2002 to the end of 2003.
395. However, as stated in paragraphs 370 and 377 above, the Chamber simply
found that there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that
the implementation of the common plan started no later than when the FPLC was
founded at the beginning of September 2002.
396. The Chamber has found that there is sufficient evidence to establish
substantial grounds to believe that while he was under house arrest from 13 August
2003 to the end of 2003, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo continued to exercise de facto within
the UPC/RP and FPLC, the powers that he had exercised since the beginning of
September 2002.
397. However, on the evidence admitted for the purpose of the confirmation
hearing, there is insufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that
while he was detained in Kinshasa from 13 August 2003 to the end of 2003, Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo continued to play a co-ordinating role in the implementation of the
common plan. In this respect, the Chamber notes that all the evidence referred to in
the preceding paragraphs pertains to events which occurred between early
September 2002 and 13 August 2003.
398. The Chamber also finds that there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial
grounds to believe that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo and the other participants in the
common plan implemented it in a co-ordinated manner, and that Thomas Lubanga
Dyilo had joint control over the implementation of the plan in so far as the essential
overall co-ordinating role which he played gave him the power to frustrate the
implementation of the plan if he refused to play his part.
399. In this regard, the Chamber has already found that there is sufficient evidence
to establish substantial grounds to believe that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, Chief Kahwa,
Rafiki Saba, Floribert Kisembo, Bosco Ntaganda and other senior FPLC commanders

(such as Tchaligonza) knew each other and had been working together from the time
of the Hema mutiny which broke out within the APC in July 2000 and which had
triggered the creation of the UPC.532 Moreover, it appears from the transcript
[REDACTED]533 and the statements of [REDACTED],534 [REDACTED]535 and
[REDACTED]536 that the other participants in the common plan allegedly visited
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo regularly and that he was allegedly briefed about FPLC
military operations and the situation in the FPLC military training camps.

532 See paragraph 168 above.
533 [REDACTED] states that [REDACTED] often went to see Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, particularly to
discuss logistic and financial difficulties ([REDACTED], line 2366 to [REDACTED], line 2379 and
[REDACTED], lines 2559-2573); Statement of [REDACTED] (DRC-OTP-0127-0084, para. 65 and DRCOTP-0127-0087, para. 81). [REDACTED] also refers to the close ties between Thomas Lubanga Dyilo

Dyilo, Bosco Ntaganda and Rafiki Saba (DRC-OTP-0105-0111, para. 144).
535 According to [REDACTED], Bosco Ntaganda used a Motorola to communicate with Thomas
Lubanga, Chief Kahwa and Floribert Kisembo (DRC-OTP-0127-0082, para. 55). In particular,
[REDACTED] points out that Bosco Ntaganda contacted Thomas Lubanga regularly. “[REDACTED]
he would contact him at least once a day and brief him on the situation and how the training was
going.“ (DRC-OTP-0127-0082, para. 56). [REDACTED] also mentions the daily communication
between Bosco Ntaganda and Rafiki Saba (DRC-OTP-0127-0091, para. 102).

400. In the view of the Chamber, the following excerpts from the speeches given by
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo and Jean de Dieu Tinanzabo before young FPLC recruits,
including those under the age of fifteen years, at the Rwampara Camp on 12
February 2003 are indicative of the level of co-ordination in the implementation of
the common plan:
TL: […] I am Thomas Lubanga, the President of our party, the UPC. I think this
is the first time that many of you have seen me… isn’t it?
ALL: Yes
TL: Ah?
ALL: Yes
TL: Have you seen me before?
[00:09:55. Cut to view of onlookers]
TL: You are used to… talking with our commanders… who are … erm… are…
helping with this… work… of training… who are…. are… building the
army every … everyday. I am with them all the time but there is a lot of
work… A lot… And… sometimes my work requires me to go abroad or I
have meetings all the time …. So it is difficult for me to meet with you all the
time.
[00:10:40 Cut to view of onlookers]
TL: …erm, the Chief of Staff, Commander Bosco, comes to see you. Does he
come here?
ALL: Yes.
TL: Does he come here regularly?
ALL: Yes.
TL: If he does not come, you tell me. Does he come here regularly?
ALL: Yes!537
JT: […] Now I have seen you, I do not want to talk for too long. Continue your
training. We are keeping an eye on you all the time. So that we can know
your problems… and solve them. You said a while ago that the Operations
Commander…. Commander Bosco comes to see you regularly. If you have
difficulties, tell him. And they will get to a higher level… of our leadership.
Because he is a senior leader of our army the FPLC.

a position to solve the logistic and financial difficulties that they sometimes had to
contend with.538
402. According to [REDACTED], [REDACTED] told him that Thomas Lubanga
“used to take most of the decisions himself without consulting with the members of
the movement’s executive”539 and “was running the movement like a dictator and
was against any dialogue within the movement.”540
403. Furthermore, when asked whether the UPC identified itself with Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo, Kristine Peduto answered as follows:
The movement recognised him as its leader. The UPC at that time was widely
described as being under the control of Mr Lubanga. The briefings I received from
my colleagues, the military observers, also indicated that that was the case.541
2. Subjective elements
a. The suspect must fulfil the subjective elements of the crime
charged
404. The Chamber finds that there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial
grounds to believe that from early September 2002 to 13 August 2003, Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo:
i. was, at the very least, aware that, in the ordinary course of events, the
implementation of the common plan would involve:
- the voluntary recruitment of children under the age of fifteen years into
the FPLC;
- the forcible recruitment of children under the age of fifteen years into
the FPLC;

- the use of children under the age of fifteen years to participate actively
in military operations and as bodyguards to protect military objectives;
ii. accepted such a result by reconciling himself with it or by condoning it.
405. In reaching this finding, the Chamber has given special consideration to the
following evidence:
i. Kristine Peduto’s written report of 26 March 2003 entitled “Histoires
individuelles – Bunia (Ituri)”, which situates Thomas Lubanga Dyilo at a
place and time where children under the age of fifteen years were being
forcibly enrolled into the FPLC;
542
ii. Kristine Peduto’s testimony about the visible presence of children under
the age of fifteen years among FPLC soldiers guarding UPC buildings in
Bunia in September 2002;543
iii. the combination of the evidence relating to:
- the extent of the voluntary and forcible recruitment of children under
the age of fifteen years into the FPLC and their active participation in
military operations and as bodyguards to protect military objectives;544
and to
- the proximity of the FPLC military training camps, where young
recruits under the age of fifteen years were receiving military training,
to Thomas Lubanga Dyilo’s residence in Bunia;545

of children under the age of fifteen years into the FPLC and their active
participation in hostilities, on the one hand, and the armed conflict taking
place in Ituri, on the other.
407. In reaching this finding, the Chamber has given special consideration to the
evidence discussed in section IV.A.1.b.
b. The suspect and the other co-perpetrators must all be
mutually aware and mutually accept that implementing their
common plan may result in the realisation of the objective
elements of the crime
408. The Chamber finds that there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial
grounds to believe that from early September 2002 to 13 August 2003:
i. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, Chief Kahwa Panga Mandro,552 Rafiki Saba,
Floribert Kisembo, Bosco Ntaganda and other senior FPLC commanders
such as Tchalingonza were aware that, in the normal course of events,
children under the age of fifteen years would be voluntarily or forcibly
recruited into the FPLC and used to participate actively in military
operations and as bodyguards to protect military objectives as a result of
implementing their common plan in furtherance of the UPC/RP and FPLC
war effort which entailed:
- the voluntary or forcible recruitment of young persons into the FPLC;
- subjecting the young FPLC recruits to military training; and
- using the young FPLC recruits to participate actively in military
operations and as bodyguards to protect military objectives.553

552 Concerning the period during which Chief Kahwa allegedly took part in implementing the common
plan, see footnote 507 above.
553 In the case of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, the Chamber has given special consideration to the evidence
discussed in the preceding sub-section. In the case of Chief Kahwa Panga Mandro, Rafiki Saba,
Floribert Kisembo, Bosco Ntaganda and Tchalingonza, the Chamber has given special consideration to
the evidence discussed in the paragraph referred to in footnote 507.

ii. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, Chief Kahwa Panga Mandro, Rafiki Saba, Floribert
Kisembo, Bosco Ntaganda and other senior FPLC commanders such as
Tchalingonza accepted the idea that the implementation of their common
plan would lead to:
- the voluntary or forcible recruitment of children under the age of fifteen
years into the FPLC; and
- using them to participate actively in military operations and as
bodyguards to protect military objectives.554
iii. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, Kahwa Panga Mandro, Rafiki Saba, Floribert
Kisembo, Bosco Ntaganda and other senior FPLC commanders such as
Tchalingonza all shared the awareness of the consequences described in
paragraphs i) and ii) above and accepted them.555
c. The suspect must be aware of the factual circumstances
enabling him or her to exercise joint control over the crime
409. The Chamber finds that there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial
grounds to believe that from early September 2002, when the FPLC was created, until
13 August 2003, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo:
i. was aware of the specific role that he played within the UPC/RP556 and the
FPLC;557

discussed in the preceding sub-section. In the case of Chief Kahwa Panga Mandro, Rafiki Saba,
Floribert Kisembo, Bosco Ntaganda and Tchalingonza, the Chamber has given special consideration to
the evidence discussed in the paragraph referred to in footnote 507.
555 In reaching this finding, the Chamber has given special consideration to i) the evidence relating to
the fact that Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, Chief Kahwa, Rafiki Saba, Floribert Kisembo, Bosco Ntaganda
and Tchalingonza knew each other and had worked together from the time of the Hema mutiny in
July 2000 which led to the establishemnt of the UPC (para. 168 above); and ii) the evidence discussed
in para. 358 above.

ii. was aware of his co-ordinating role in the implementation of the common
plan in furtherance of the UPC/RP and FPLC war effort a) by voluntarily or
forcibly recruiting young people into the FPLC; b) by subjecting them to
military training; and c) by using them to participate actively in military
operations and as bodyguards to protect military objectives;558
iii. was aware of the essential nature of his co-ordinating role in the
implementation of the common plan and of his ability to frustrate the
implementation of the plan by refusing to play this co-ordinating role.559
3. Conclusion
410. Accordingly, the Chamber finds that there is sufficient evidence to establish
substantial grounds to believe that from early September 2002 to 13 August 2003,
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo incurred criminal responsibility as a co-perpetrator within
the meaning of article 25(3)(a) of the Statute for the crimes referred to in Section IV of
this decision.

558 In reaching this finding, the Chamber has given special consideration to: i) the video recording of
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo’s visit to Rwampara Camp on 12 February 2003 during which, after
introducing himself as the “President of your party“, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo explained to the recruits,
including those under the age of fifteen years, that, “You are used to… talking with our
commanders… who are … erm… are… helping with this… work… of training… who are…. are…
building the army every … everyday. I am with them all the time but there is a lot of work… A lot…
And… sometimes my work requires me to go abroad or I have meetings all the time …. So it is
difficult for me to meet with you all the time.” (DRC-OTP-0120-0343, lines 169-175); ii) the transcript of
the Prosecution’s interview of [REDACTED], which shows that [REDACTED] ([REDACTED], line
2366 to [REDACTED], line 2411), and [REDACTED] ([REDACTED], lines 2565-2566) often had to meet
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, the only person in a position to resolve the logistic and financial difficulties
that they sometimes had to contend with; iii) the transcript of the Prosecution’s interview of
[REDACTED] and the statements of [REDACTED], [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], who allege that
other participants in the common plan often visited Thomas Lubanga Dyilo and that he was de facto
regularly briefed about the general situation in Ituri and, in particular, about FPLC military operations
and the situation in the FPLC military training camps (see footnotes 533 to 536); and iv) the Statements
of [REDACTED] (DRC-OTP-0108-0129, paras. 30 and 31), [REDACTED] (DRC-OTP-0126-0129, para.
34), [REDACTED] (DRC-OTP-0126-0158, para. 23) regarding the visits paid by Thomas Lubanga Dyilo
to FPLC military training camps located in [REDACTED] when they were under FPLC control, and
where FPLC recruits under the age of fiteeen years were undergoing military training.
559 In reaching this finding, the Chamber has given special consideration to the evidence referred to in
the preceding footnote.

FOR THESE REASONS,
RECALLS that in its decisions of 10 February 2006 and 3 October 2006, the Chamber
found that the instant case fell within the jurisdiction of the Court and was
admissible pursuant to article 17 of the Statute, and DECLARES that no new
submissions were made before the Chamber in this regard;
DECLARES that the Chamber did not decide anew upon the numerous Prosecution
Rule 81 applications which are affected by the judgements rendered by the Appeals
Chamber on 14 December as the Chamber is satisfied that the “sufficient evidence to
establish substantial grounds to believe” standard under article 61(7) of the Statute
has been met without reference to the Prosecution evidence affected by those
judgements;
DECIDES to apply, in Annexes I and II of this decision, the guiding principles
prescribed in the judgements rendered by the Appeals Chamber on 14 December
2006 to the redactions authorised to the following documents after the decisions
affected by the said judgements were rendered:
i) the statements of [REDACTED], Kristine Peduto and [REDACTED],
ii) the transcript of the interview of [REDACTED],
iii) documents related to the said statements and transcripts;
DECIDES to admit into evidence the items seized from the home of [REDACTED];
DECLARES that the Defence has not presented sufficient evidence to lead to the
conclusion that some Prosecution evidence was obtained as a result of the seizure
conducted by Uruguayan MONUC forces on 6 September 2003, and that, as a result,
the Chamber is under no obligation to consider whether items originally seized by
these forces are admissible under article 69(7) of the Statute for the purpose of the
confirmation hearing;

[REDACTED] and DECLARES that the probative value of these attestations was
determined in the context of the assessment of the totality of the evidence admitted
for the purpose of the confirmation hearing;
DECLARES that, in respect of the Defence challenge to the credibility and reliability
of statements made by children and the entire testimony of Kristine Peduto, the
Chamber attached more probative value to those pieces of evidence from the children
and from Kristine Peduto that were corroborated by other evidence admitted for the
purpose of the confirmation hearing;
DENIES the Defence application challenging the admission into evidence of four
reports presented by the Prosecution at the hearing of 27 November 2006 concerning

d’appel de Paris presented by the Prosecution at the hearing of 27 November 2006 and
DECLARES these reports to be admissible as evidence;
DENIES the Defence objections relating to the admissibility and probative value of
some of the witness statements disclosed to the Defence;
DECLARES, in regard to the Prosecution application challenging the authenticity of
some pieces of evidence presented by the Defence and requesting that no probative
value be attached thereto, that the Chamber determined the probative value of these
pieces of evidence on a case-by-case basis;

conclude that the Prosecution did not disclose to the Defence the bulk of potentially
exculpatory evidence or evidence that could be material to the preparation of the
Defence;
CONFIRMS, on the evidence admitted for the purpose of the confirmation hearing,
that there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds to believe that
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo is responsible, as a co-perpetrator, for the charges of enlisting
and conscripting children under the age of fifteen years into the FPLC and using
them to participate actively in hostilities within the meaning of articles 8(2)(b)(xxvi)
