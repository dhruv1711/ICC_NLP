Background
1. On 23 May 2006, Defence filed a "REQUETE DE MISE EN LIBERTE"1
(Application), requesting the Single Judge of the Pre-Trial Chamber (Single
Judge) to order the release of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO.2
2. On 29 May 2006, the (full) Pre-Trial Chamber issued its "Ordonnance relative
à la requête aux fins de mise en liberté"3
 (29 May 2006 Order), requesting the
Defence to inform the Pre-Trial Chamber to which State Thomas LUBANGA
DYILO requests to be released.4
 On 31 May 2006, the Defence filed its
"Conclusions relatives à l'ordonnance du 29.5.2006"5
 (31 May 2006 Defence
Submission), informing the Pre-Trial Chamber that Thomas LUBANGA
DYILO wishes to be released to either Belgium or the United Kingdom,6
 and
clarified that the Application, based on Rule 185 of the Rules of Procedure
and Evidence (Rules) is aiming at release, as distinguished from provisional
release.7
3. On 2 June 2006, the Single Judge, by way of the "Ordonnance priant le
Greffier de fournir des observations sur les conditions de détention de
Thomas Lubanga Dyilo"8
 (2 June 2006 Order), requested the Registrar to
provide observations on the conditions of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO's
detention by 5 June 2006.9

Preliminary remark
4. The Prosecution notes10
 that the Application has neglected applicable
Regulations of the Court (Regulations) that govern the page limits and the
format of filings with the Court. These violations of the Regulations include,
inter alia:"
(i) The Application is comprised of 25 pages, thus violating Regulation
37(1), which states that a document filed with the Registry shall not
exceed 20 pages. None of the exceptions as determined by
Regulation 38 applies.12
 To the knowledge of the Prosecution, the
Defence has not applied for an extension of the page limit pursuant
to Regulation 37(2),13
 and neither the Pre-Trial Chamber nor the
Single Judge has granted such an extension.
(ii) The Application is written in single spacing, thus violating
Regulation 36(4), which states that documents filed with the
Registry shall use 1.5 line spacing.
5. The Prosecution, however, has an even greater concern that the Defence in
the public Application makes repeated reference to portions of a confidential
10
 The Prosecution makes these observations for the sole purpose of ensuring that future Defence
filings are, as with Prosecution's filings, complying with the applicable Regulations. The
Prosecution does not request the Pre-Trial Chamber or the Single Judge to act upon the
Prosecution's observations.
11
 The Prosecution notes that the Defence has also not provided a book of authorities.
12
 Whilst it appears that the Application is a challenge to the jurisdiction of the Court, Defence has
failed to provide a clear characterisation of the Application. The Prosecution draws the attention
of the Pre-Trial Chamber to the fact that the Defence on 12 June 2006 has withdrawn its appeal
that was based on similar considerations.
13
 Neither prior to filing the Application nor as part of the Application.

filing of REDACTED and even quotes extensively from its confidential
Annexes.14
Procedural aspects
6. The Application is not, as the Defence itself states,15
 a request for interim
release in terms of Article 60 (2). Rather, the Application appears to be a
challenge to the jurisdiction of the Court, based on the alleged illegality of
Thomas LUBANGA DYILO's prior detention in the DRC and of the process
of his arrest for and surrender to the Court.16
7. The Defence has failed to provide a clear characterization of its request or to
properly identify a legal basis for it, other than a brief reference to Rule 185.
This provision, however, only deals with the procedure to be followed once a
person is released from the custody of the Court other than upon completion
of sentence. Rule 185 does not provide a legal foundation for release, a
measure that necessarily requires a previous determination by the Court
terminating the exercise of jurisdiction over the relevant person (e.g., a
negative decision on jurisdiction or admissibility, or an acquittal). The
Prosecution should not be required to "reconstruct" the nature and normative
basis of an application made by another participant. For the purposes of the
instant litigation, the Prosecution will assume, and in an effort to assist the
Pre-Trial-Chamber in the expeditious determination of the relevant issues,
that the Defence has filed a challenge to the jurisdiction of the Court under
Article 19, and will deal with it accordingly. The Prosecution reserves its
14
 See at paras. 5 and 6 of the Application.
15
 See paragraph 2 above.
16
 The Prosecution notes that under the terms of Article 19(4) of the Statute, by filing the
Application, the Defence has made use of its opportunity to challenge the jurisdiction of the
Court.

Prosecution as not being correct.
Alleged illegality of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO's arrest and detention in the
DRC
Duration of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO's detention in the DRC
8. The Prosecution draws the attention of the Pre-Trial Chamber to the fact that
the information on the duration of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO's alleged
house arrest and subsequent detention in the DRC is, at the very least,
misrepresenting the facts. Repeatedly, the Defence - making no difference
between the time prior to 19 March 2005, the date of Thomas LUBANGA
DYILO's arrest, and after 19 March 2005 - either suggests or explicitly states17
that Thomas LUBANGA DYILO was deprived of his liberty in the DRC since
13 August 2003.18
9. This statement is both unsubstantiated and factually incorrect:
(i) The Prosecution notes that, other than making the respective
allegation, the Defence does not provide any details on the alleged
house arrest of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO prior to March 2005.
This in itself is indicative in respect of the reliability of the
respective statement. It is even more indicative when combined
with the fact that the Defence in the Application uses a number of
different terms for Thomas LUBANGA DYILO's alleged house
17
 Reference is made to, inter alia, paras. 3,11,12,15,16 and 18 of the Application.
18
 What includes a significant portion of the time-period - July 2002 to December 2003 - that is
detailed in the arrest warrant against Thomas LUBANGA DYILO.
No. : ICC-01/04-01/06 5 13 June 2006
ICC-01/04-01/06-150 13-06-2006 5/18 SL PT
arrest prior to 19 March 2005. These terms range from "restricted
freedom measures"/9
 "deprived of his liberty",20
 "house arrest"21
and "held arbitrarily"22
 to "detention".23
(ii) Whilst it appears to be true that Thomas LUBANGA DYILO from
mid-August 2003 onwards spent significant portions of his time in
Kinshasa, the evidence and information available to the
Prosecution shows that he throughout 2003 and 2004 was able to
move freely and to communicate, without restrictions, with
whomever he wanted, including individuals within the UPC and
the FPLC.24
 This is, inter alia,25
 evidenced by the fact that THOMAS
LUBANGA DYILO was able to give interviews throughout the
time he was allegedly deprived of his liberty.26
 Furthermore, the
Prosecution considers it significant that on 8 December 2003,
Thomas LUBANGA DYILO, as the President of the UPC, signed a
decree REDACTED.27
10. To the knowledge of the Prosecution,28
 Thomas LUBANGA DYILO was
arrested on 19 March 2005, after the DRC authorities had placed him under
various forms of house arrest for about two weeks immediately prior to 19
19

 See Application, at para. 11.
21
 See Application, at para.3.
22
 See Application, at para. 12.
23
 See Application, at para. 18.
24
 Thus, Thomas LUBANGA DYILO throughout 2003 and afterwards continued to be in charge of
both the UPC and the FPLC.
25
 The Prosecution draws the attention of the Pre-Trial Chamber to the fact that at this stage it can
only provide information and evidence that is not - or not anymore - protected by agreements
pursuant to Article 54(3)(e) of the Statute.

 As detailed in the Prosecutor's Application for Warrant of Arrest, Article 58 (12 January 2006

March 2005. Since then, and only since then, he was detained in the Centre
Pénitentiaire et de Reeducation de Kinshasa.
No impact of the alleged irregularities of the detention in the DRC on the legality of the
ICC proceedings
11. The Prosecution submits that, even if there were aspects in the proceedings in
the DRC that may entail violations of the law governing the domestic
proceedings,29
 they do not impact on the legality of the proceedings of the
Court against Thomas LUBANGA DYILO. Even if such violations existed,
they could not be attributed to the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) - or to the
Pre-Trial Chamber -, either legally or factually. Consequently, they would
not impact on the legality of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO's arrest for and
surrender to the Court and his detention in the Court's Detention Centre
since then.
12. The knowledge of the Prosecution in respect of the reasons for and details of
Thomas LUBANGA DYILO's detention in the DRC prior to his arrest for and
surrender to the Court was determined by and limited to the information
contained in the NOTE SYNOPTIQUE SUR ETAT DE LA PROCEDUREDOSSIER DE L'ITURI of 10 August 2005 (NOTE SYNOPTIQUE),30
 the copy of
the DRC file on Thomas LUBANGA DYILO's detention,31
 and discussions
with representatives of the DRC authorities.32
 The Prosecution has

 The Prosecution is not in a position to assess whether there had or had not been such violations.
30
 The NOTE SYNOPTIQUE was attached as Annex 3 to the Ex Parte "Prosecution's Submissions
of Further Information and Materials", filed on 25 January 2006 (25 January 2006 Prosecution
Filing). The 25 January 2006 Prosecution Filing was reclassified as confidential on 20 March 2006.
In addition, the Prosecution has disclosed the NOTE SYNOPTIQUE to the Defence on 23 May
2006.

ICC-01/04-01/06-150 13-06-2006 7/18 SL PT
comprehensively shared this information with the Pre-Trial Chamber, in both
filings33
 and at the occasion of the Court hearing of 2 February 2006.34
 Based
on this official information,35
 there was - neither for the Prosecution nor for
the Pre-Trial Chamber - and still is no reason to believe that the arrest and
detention of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO in the DRC was illegal. To the
contrary, the information provided on its face confirmed the legal basis for
the DRC proceedings against Thomas LUBANGA DYILO. In particular, and
contrary to the Defence's assertion that Thomas LUBANGA DYILO was
never informed about the charges against him or of the cause of those
charges,36
 the NOTE SYNOPTIQUE clearly states that Thomas LUBANGA
DYILO was informed about the allegations that led to his arrest in the DRC.37
13. The information the OTP had at its disposal38
 prior to the issuance of the
arrest warrant against Thomas LUBANGA DYILO on 10 February 2006 did
not give cause to inquire into the legality of the DRC proceedings against
Thomas LUBANGA DYILO. Against this background, the allegation made
by the Defence that the Prosecution - and the Pre-Trial Chamber39
 - has
(deliberately) failed to intercede in the DRC,40
 has accordingly endorsed and
33
 See in particular the 25 January 2006 Prosecution Filing, at paras. 3, 4, 8 to 15,17 to 19, and 22(i).
34
 See (English) transcript (Redacted Version) of the 2 February 2006 Court hearing, at pages 9 to
13, 38 and 39.
35
 The Prosecution is aware of the criticism expressed by international NGOs in relation to the
DRC proceedings, including, inter alia, in respect of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO. Human Rights
Watch stated that there had been a "clear violation of Congolese legal procedures" (see Human Rights
Watch's 15 December 2005 Report "Democratic Republic of Congo - Elections in sight: 'Don't
Rock the Boat'", at page 15). The Prosecution has provided the Pre-Trial Chamber with the
respective information (see 25 January 2006 Prosecution Filing, at para.ll).
36
 See Application, at para. 9.
37
 See NOTE SYNOPTIQUE, at page 8: "REDACTED."
38
 And shared with the Pre-Trial Chamber.
39
 The Prosecution notes that the Defence in the context of the respective allegations is repeatedly
making reference to "the ICC".

assisted in the violation of fundamental rules of international law41
 and has
taken advantage of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO's alleged illegal detention/2
 is
lacking a factual basis.43
14. The Defence's assertion44
 that both the OTP and the Pre-Trial Chamber had, at
the time of the determination on the 12 January 2006 Application on 10
February 2006, and based on the view that Thomas LUBANGA DYILO may
be released soon and flee, considered the illegality of his arrest and detention
in the DRC, is misconstrued. The OTP at the time was only concerned that
Thomas LUBANGA DYILO may be released by the DRC authorities prior to
the Court's request for arrest and surrender. Both the Prosecution and the
Pre-Trial Chamber had indeed reason to believe that Thomas LUBANGA
DYILO could be released in the near future. This belief was based on the fact
that the local investigations against him turned out to be very difficult, in
particular in light of the capacity of the DRC authorities to investigate the
underlying facts within the time-frame as determined by the DRC law. This
41
 See Application at para. 30. The allegation is made implicitly.
42
 See Application at para. 32.
43
 The Prosecution has nevertheless extensively reviewed the jurisprudence as quoted by the
Defence in support of the view that "the ICC" was under a duty to investigate the legality of the
arrest and detention of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO in the DRC. The Prosecution notes that in
respect of all quoted jurisprudence the Defence has neglected substantial differences in respect of
the underlying facts and thus has drawn inappropriate analogies: (1) In Loizidou vs. Turkey (see
Application, at para. 31), the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) found that Turkey
exercised "effective overall control" in the region concerned (Northern Cyprus). This situation of
"effective overall control" is fundamentally different to the situation in respect of the ICC's
mandate and legal and factual capability to influence or control national proceedings; (2) In
Naletilic vs. Croatia (see Application, at para. 31), the conclusion of the Defence is not supported
by any finding in the Decision of the ECHR. To the contrary, the ECHR rejected the complaints of
the Applicant; (3) In Mansur vs. Turkey (see Application, at para. 33) and Kalashnikov vs. Russia
(see Application, at para. 33), the Applicants were held in detention by Turkey and Russia
respectively throughout the proceedings. In both cases, the ECHR had to determine on the
impact of the States concerned having joined the European Convention on Human Rights only
after the alleged violations of human rights, and not on a situation similar to the one of Thomas
LUBANGA DYILO.
44
 See Application, at para. 20: "The Defence is deeply concerned by such reasoning".
No. : ICC-01/04-01/06 9 13 June 2006
ICC-01/04-01/06-150 13-06-2006 9/18 SL PT
consideration, however, had no bearing on the legality of Thomas LUBANGA
DYILO's arrest and detention in the DRC.
15. In any event, the arrest and detention of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO in
March 2005 was not triggered by a request or any other involvement of the
OTP, nor had the OTP or any other organ of the Court prior to the notification
of the Auditeur Général des FARDC (Auditeur Général) of the DRC pursuant
to Article 87 of the Statute on 15 March 2006 made a request to keep Thomas
LUBANGA DYILO in custody. Thus, given that (1) Thomas LUBANGA
DYILO was not arrested and detained in the DRC "at the behest of"45
 the OTP
and, consequently, (2) that he was not in the Court's "constructive custody"46
prior to his arrest and surrender on 16 March 2006, the alleged violation of
the rights of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO cannot be attributed to the OTP or
the Court.
16. Even if the detention of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO in the DRC were
attributable to the OTP - which it is not -, the extraordinary remedy of release
would be disproportionate to the alleged violation of the rights of Thomas
LUBANGA DYILO.47
45
 The Prosecution makes reference to the Decision of the ICTR Appeals Chamber in Barayagiviza
vs. The Prosecutor, Decision, 3 November 1999 (First Bamyagwiza Appeals Decision), in particular
at paras. 43 to 45, 52 and 54. The Prosecution notes that whilst the Defence has put much weight
on this Decision, having quoted it extensively in support of the Application, it has neglected the
fundamental differences in respect of the underlying facts between the case of The Prosecutor vs.
Barayagiviza and the instant case: Barayagwiza's detention in Cameroon from 4 March 1997 until
his transfer to the ICTR's Detention Unit on 19 November 1997 was triggered by an official request
of the ICTR Prosecutor. The Prosecution in addition makes reference to The Prosecutor vs.
Rwamakuba, ICTR-98-44-T, Decision on the Defence Motion Concerning the Illegal Arrest and
Illegal Detention of the Accused, 12 December 2000, at paras. 30 and 33.

17. Thomas LUBANGA DYILO was arrested for and surrendered to the Court in
compliance with the requirements as outlined in Article 59 of the Statute and
Rule 117. In particular, the allegations that the proceedings pursuant to
Article 59 of the Statute were not conducted before the competent judicial
authorities and that Thomas LUBANGA DYILO was not served the arrest
warrant at the time of his arrest in the DRC lack a factual basis.
Competent judicial authorities
18. The arrest proceedings in the DRC pursuant to Article 59 of the Statute were
conducted before the Auditeur Général, the competent judicial organ of the
DRC.48
 In preparation of, at the time, possible future arrest and surrender
proceedings, the competence of the Auditeur Général was subject to
discussions in January and February 2006 between the OTP and the DRC
authorities. A report submitted at the request of the OTP by the DRC
authorities,49
 identifying, with reasons, the Auditeur Général as the
competent organ within the DRC judicial system to conduct the Article 59
arrest and surrender proceedings, formed the basis for discussions between

refers to the Decision of the ICTR Appeals Chamber in the case of Semanza vs. The Prosecutor,

Information about the charges
21. The Prosecution has noted with surprise the statement of the Defence that

"Decision concerning Pre-Trial Chamber I's Decision of 10 February 2006 and the Incorporation
of Documents into the Record of the Case against Mr Thomas Lubanga Dyilo" (24 February 2006
Decision), noting, inter alia, "articles 57(3)(c), 67(1) and 68(1) of the Rome Statute, Rules 87(2)(c)
and 88(4) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence" - thus aspects of the protection of victims and
witnesses -, and considering, inter alia, that Thomas LUBANGA DYILO "has right of access to a
readable version of the part of the Decision that refers to the case against him ...". On 17 March
2006, the Pre-Trial Chamber reclassified the 24 February 2006 Decision and the formatted and
redacted version of the 10 February 2006 Decision as public.

(iii)Furthermore, and in particular, Defence and thus Thomas LUBANGA
DYILO have access63
 to the Prosecution's 12 January 2006 Application.
The 12 January 2006 Application contains, though redacted and
formatted,64
 in compliance with Article 58(2)(b) of the Statute "[A]
concise statement of the facts which are alleged to constitute those
crimes". It provides furthermore, as requested by Article 58(2)(d) of
the Statute, "[A] summary of the evidence and any other information
which establish reasonable grounds to believe that the person
committed those crimes." This information is very detailed in respect
of the facts of the crimes for which the Prosecution considers Thomas
LUBANGA DYILO criminally responsible.65
Aspects in the Application that have no direct bearing on the determination on
the Application
23. In the Prosecution's view, the statements made by the Defence in respect of
disclosure and the conditions in the Detention Centre have no direct bearing
on the Application. In light of the fact that the statements made by the
Defence are factually incorrect, the Prosecution nevertheless addresses these
statements as follows:
63
 The formatted and redacted version of the 12 January 2006 Application was reclassified as
"confidential" on 22 March 2006.

 In compliance with the 24 February 2006 Decision, at page 6, the Prosecution has redacted and
formatted the 12 January 2006 Application. The Prosecution notes that the same considerations of
the Pre-Trial Chamber as detailed in footnote 62 above did apply.

Disclosure
24. The Prosecution has noted, again with surprise, the statement of the Defence
that "the Prosecutor still has not disclosed any evidence of a strictly
incriminating nature that is of use to the Defence".66
 This allegation is -
unfortunately again - grossly neglecting the facts.
25. The Prosecution makes reference to the extensive information it has provided
to the Pre-Trial Chamber and Counsel for the Defence in the course of the 24
May 200667
 closed session Court hearing on its past disclosure activities, the
current status of disclosure and the plans of the Prosecution to ensure
continued compliance with its disclosure obligations in future. As part of this
information, the Prosecution has informed the Pre-Trial Chamber68
 that it has
disclosed, to date, REDACTED.69
26. Furthermore, on 2 June 2006 and on 9 June 2006, the Prosecution has,
pursuant to Rule 77, provided for inspection of a total of six documents,
comprised of 23 pages.
27. In addition, REDACTED. This information formed the basis for the Single
Judge to outline the future disclosure process between the Parties in the
"Decision on the Postponement of the Confirmation Hearing and the
66
 See Application, at para. 29.
67
 The Prosecution realizes that the Court hearing took place the day after the filing of the
Application. Nevertheless, Defence, having received the disclosure materials at various
disclosure meetings prior to the Court hearing, was aware of the facts forming the basis for the
information the Prosecution had provided to the Pre-Trial Chamber at the occasion of the
hearing.
68
 See (English) transcript of the 24 May 2006 Court hearing, at pages 18 to 19.
69
 Whilst the Prosecution would be prepared to in the instant public filing provide further
information on its past disclosure activities, having ensured compliance with its statutory
obligations, it realizes that the 24 May 2006 Court hearing was a closed session Court hearing.
Consequently, the Prosecution is not in a position to in a public filing include this information.

Adjustment of the Timetable set in the Decision on the Final System of
Disclosure".70
28. As the Prosecution has complied in the past with all Court decisions on
disclosure, it will do so in future, fully discharging its respective statutory
duties.
Conditions of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO's detention
29. Pursuant to Regulation 90, it is the Registry that has the responsibility for all
aspects of the Detention Centre.71
 Accordingly, the Prosecution refrains from
making observations on the conditions of Thomas LUBANGA DYILO's
detention.
30. The Prosecution has taken note of the contents of the REDACTED. In the
Prosecution's view, based on the information provided, the conditions in
which Thomas LUBANGA DYILO is detained are in compliance with the
law.
31. The Prosecution explicitly confirms the observations in the REDACTED in
respect of the OTP agreement - after having carefully balanced possible
security concerns with Thomas LUBANGA DYILO's legitimate interest to
have a person to talk to - to allow contact between Thomas LUBANGA
DYILO and REDACTED.72

Public formatted and redacted version
32. Due to aspects in the present submission that address matters contained in
confidential filings and information that was provided in closed session
Court hearings, the Prosecution has filed the present submission as a
"Confidential" document. The Prosecution will file a public formatted and
redacted version as soon as practicable.
Request
33. In light of the foregoing reasons, the Prosecution requests the Pre-Trial
Chamber to reject the Application.
