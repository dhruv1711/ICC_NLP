the DRC.
NAIROBI, 23 Jan 2004 (IRIN) - The head of the UN
Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, William
Swing, summoned on Wednesday militia leader Thomas
Lubanga to express his indignation over attacks by the
Union des Patriotes Congolais (UPC) fighters against UN
troops in the northeastern district of Ituri, Orientale
Province, an official said.
"MONUC would not tolerate the concept of uncontrolled
armed groups," Hamadoun Touré, the spokesman of the
UN mission, said in a statement announcing Swing's
move against Lubanga.
Swing told Lubanga that militia leaders would have to
account for their troops' actions. "MONUC's role in Ituri
is to protect civilian populations and to restore peace,"
Toure said. "It will, therefore, continue using
appropriate retaliatory means for enough is enough."
He announced that by March or April, MONUC would
have deployed troops to several other areas in Ituri, including Mahagi and Aru in the northeast of
Ituri.
UN News reported on Thursday that MONUC had blamed the militia attacks against its troops on
a recently promoted UPC militia leader, Bosco Ntaganda, who it accused of summary executions
of civilians, abductions and daily extortion.
"He is charged, among other things, with the summary executions of two people in Bunia in
March 2003, kidnappings, rapes, barbaric acts on civilian populations, daily extortion of people's
money and items in Ituri, illegal levying of taxes and other offences," UN News reported, quoting
MONUC.
UN News reported that Swing had asked Lubanga to end Ntaganda's attacks on UN forces and
local civilians. Lubanga appointed Ntaganda UPC's army chief of staff on 8 December 2003.
The latest of the attacks occurred on Wednesday when UPC militiamen opened fire on a Pakistani
unit of MONUC in Nizi, 28 km north of Bunia, the main town in Ituri. Another group of UN
peacekeepers, who were in a helicopter, were attacked by the UPC at Drodro and Iga-Barrière on
19 and 20 January, UN News reported.
