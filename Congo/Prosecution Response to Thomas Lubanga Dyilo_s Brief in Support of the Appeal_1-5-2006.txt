Procedural history
1. On 17 March 2006, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo ("the Appellant") was surrendered and
transferred to the Court pursuant to a "Warrant of Arrest"1
 and a "Request for Arrest
Addressed to the Authorities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo""" issued by
Pre-Trial Chamber I. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo made his first appearance before the
Court, pursuant to Article 60 (1), on 20 March 2006.3
2. On 20 March 2006, counsel for the Appellant indicated that he wished to appeal
against the admissibility of the case and the jurisdiction of the Court, filing before PreTrial Chamber I an "Application by Duty Counsel for Extension of the Time-Limit to
Appeal and for Disclosure of the Office of the Prosecutor's Case File" in which he
requested an extension by 30 days of the time-limit to appeal, and further requested
"that the Court ... provide the accused and his counsel with access to the Prosecutor's
entire case file against the accused".4
3. On 22 March 2006, the Pre-Trial Chamber ruled that it was not competent to entertain
the application for extension of time, as appeals against jurisdiction and admissibility
are made directly to the Appeals Chamber.5
 The Pre-Trial Chamber further outlined
its prior decisions on the content of the record of the case and the situation available to
the Appellant, and sought the Prosecution's observations on the request by the
Appellant for further access.6
4. The Prosecution responded on 24 March 2006, submitting that the "Statute and the
Rules of Procedure and Evidence do not provide for a person subject to a warrant of
arrest ... to have access to the Prosecution's entire case-file",7
 and that the Appellant

already had access to all relevant information, which was "formatted and/or redacted
... by the Pre-Trial Chamber and the Prosecution" pursuant to the Statute.8
5. On 24 March 2006, the Appellant filed an appeal pursuant to Rule 154, asking that the
Appeals Chamber declare that the case is inadmissible and the warrant of arrest was
improperly issued against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo.9
6. On 10 April 2006, the Appellant filed his "Brief filed under regulation 64 in support of
the appeal of 27 March 2006".'° The Prosecution now files its response to the
Appellant's Brief, pursuant to Regulation 64 (4).
Preliminary considerations
7. The Prosecution firstly submits that it is questionable whether this appeal should have
been brought at all before the Appeals Chamber at this stage. In particular, the
Prosecution notes that the Appellant was not faced with a choice between lodging this
appeal or foregoing his right to raise matters related to admissibility or jurisdiction. On
the contrary, as the determinations of jurisdiction and admissibility reached by the PreTrial Chamber in its Decision were necessarily provisional in nature and made solely
to establish the legal basis for issuing an arrest warrant under Article 58, the Appellant
was entitled to challenge both jurisdiction and admissibility under Article 19 in due
course. The Prosecution made this position clear to the Appellant in its response to his
first application for an extension of time.' '
8. The Prosecution further notes that under the Appellant's account of events, he was
apparently notified of the Decision on 19 March 2006.12
 This may have misled the
Appellant into believing that his only available opportunity to raise issues pertaining to
communication du dossier du Bureau du Procureur'', ICC-01704-01/06-55, 24 March 2006, at para. 4
(hereinafter, the "Prosecution's Response").

(hereinafter the "24 March 2006 Appeal").

admissibility and/or jurisdiction was to file an appeal within the time-limit prescribed
by Rule 154, which was arguably triggered by the notification.1
" The Pre-Trial
Chamber, however, had only ordered Registry to notify by way of personal service to
the accused the warrant of arrest and the relevant legal provisions from the Court's
basic documents, a decision consistent with Rule 117 and Regulation 31 (3).14
9. The Prosecution submits that as a general principle a distinction must be drawn
between notification, within the terms of Regulation 31, and access to the record by
counsel. The former denotes the operation of transmission of judicial decisions or
filings to all those who are participating in the relevant situation or case at the time of
the filing of the document or of the issuance of the decision; the latter refers to a
different operation, namely access by someone who has just become a participant,
within the meaning of the Regulations of the Court, to the record of the proceedings
conducted prior to him or her becoming one (and therefore acquiring access rights).
10. Only the process of notification, as described above, triggers the relevant time-limits
prescribed by the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and the Regulations of the Court to
file responses, appeals, replies or applications. This is apparent, since only those who
are participating in the situation or case at the time of the relevant filing or decision
enjoy procedural rights before the Court and are therefore entitled to react to such
filing or decision by filing their own document, as defined by Regulation 22.
Conversely, a person that becomes a participant at a later stage does not acquire, by
virtue of his or her subsequent access to the record, a right to retroactively participate
in procedures that are already closed: for instance, a participant who, while examining
the record, becomes aware of the existence of a decision entered 12 months prior to his
or her accessing the record and which he or she deems prejudicial to his or her
interests, may not seek appellate review of that decision.15
 To conclude otherwise
would turn the Court's criminal process into a highly unstable set of procedural steps
which, instead of moving forward in a sequential manner, may be revisited or "'turned
back" at any point in time by the simple inclusion of a new participant.
13
 Rule 154(1) provides that an appeal may be filed, inter alia, pursuant to Article 82(1 )(a) "not later than five
days from the date upon which the party filing the appeal is notified of the decision."

15
 This does not mean that such participant may no seek a different remedy, in the form of an application or
motion, in order to have the matter revisited by the relevant Chamber, where appropriate.

The request for an extension of time
11. At paragraph 2.2 of his Brief, the Appellant submits that having "not received the
disclosure materials to which he is entitled, [he] is unable to provide grounds for [his]
appeal", since he allegedly "does not have the materials on which Pre-Trial Chamber I
based its decision."16
 This assertion is inaccurate. As the Appellant himself explains,
he has had access to a number of documents, listed in the in the annex to the
Appellant's Brief.17
 These documents include all of the documents relevant to the
Appellant's case that were provided to the Pre-Trial Chamber for the purposes of
supporting the Prosecution's application for warrants of arrest under Article 58, i.e. the
very "materials on which Pre-Trial Chamber I based its decision", to use the
Appellant's own words. In those instances where the documents have been formatted
and/or redacted, this has been done by the Pre-Trial Chamber and the Prosecution
under the Statute and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence, in particular for the
purposes of protection of victims and witnesses pursuant to Articles 57 (3) (c) and 68
(1) of the Rome Statute. However, these redactions and/or formatting of the
documents have been performed only to the extent necessary to prevent access to
identifying features of protected victims and witnesses or to information related to
further investigative efforts not covering the present case; the substance of the
information contained in the documents is not affected by them.18
 All these
explanations have been already provided to the Appellant.19
12. Thus, the Appellant had in his possession at the time of the filing of his Brief all the
material necessary for the purposes of bringing an appeal against the Pre-Trial
Chamber's Decision, and should have fully developed his arguments in the document
in support of the appeal, as required by the law of this Court. Further, the Prosecution
notes that an appeal is a corrective process: the burden on the Appellant is to
demonstrate an error made by the Chamber, considering the relevant legal principles
16

 The Appellant obviously has not had access to other confidential materials in the situation record which do not
form part of the Appellant's case. See further "Prosecution's Observations on Disclosure", ICC-01/04-01/06-67-
AnxA, 6 April 2006, at para. 10; "Prosecution's Response to, inter alia, the Request of the Defence for
Unrestricted Access to the Entire Record of the Situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo", ICC-01/04-
01/06-86, 26 April 2006, at para. 10-11.

and the materials at the Chamber's disposal at the time of the decision. Materials in
possession of a participant that were not filed before the Chamber, and consequently
were not considered in the Chamber's decision-making process, are accordingly not
relevant at this stage.20
13. The Prosecution therefore submits that the Appellant has failed to establish "good
cause" for an extension of time, within the meaning of Regulation 35, and
consequently his request should be rejected. The Appellant has access to all of the
documents required to file a document in support of appeal. The further access that
the Appellant seeks, to the entire situation file and to unredacted versions of every
document submitted to the Pre-Trial Chamber, is not material to the present
proceeding and as such does not constitute good cause.21
 Where an appellant has
access to the information required to file his appeal, "it is not in the interests of justice
to delay the filing of the Appellant's Briefs merely because of the possibility that such
additional arguments or grounds of appeal may be discovered in that [potential further]
material."22
The reservations on disclosure
14. In his Brief, the Appellant also raises certain "reservations" about disclosure.23
 These
reservations are expressed in general terms, referring to the obligation on the
Prosecutor to "disclose his or her evidence" under Rules 76 and 77, and to Article 61
(3) (b). The Appellant asserts that "in order to verify the legality of his arrest and the
20
 If the Appellant wishes to argue on the basis of other material that the case is inadmissible, rather than arguing
that the Chamber erred in its determination based on the information before it, then the proper procedural vehicle
is a challenge to admissibility under Article 19 rather than an appeal - see para 7 above.
:
' The Prosecution does not dispute that a delay in receiving materials which are material or essential to the
preparation of an appeal may justify an extension of time in some circumstances - see e.g. Prosecutor v Kvocka
et ai, IT-98-30/1-A, Decision on Request for Extension of Time to Appeal, 19 September 2002. Further, the
Appeals Chamber should be particularly cautious about granting the extension requested in this case given its
open-ended nature - see, a contrario, Bagosora et al. v The Prosecutor, ICTR-98-41-AR72(C), Decision on
Motion for Extension of Time to File an Appeal, 19 September 2003, referring to both "materials essential to the
preparation of the appeal" and "the short duration of the extension requested".

information sought is required for a legitimate forensic purpose, and having considered such additional material
considers that there are additional arguments or grounds of appeal, then he may apply to add them - ibid, at
paras. 21-22. See also Prosecutor v Kordic andCerke:, IT-95-14/2-A, Decision on Second Motions to Extend

admissibility of the case [he] must have this material at his disposal from the moment
of his arrest".24
15. Issues relating to the regime for disclosure are presently before the Pre-Trial Chamber.
The Pre-Trial Chamber has established an interim system of disclosure,25
 and the
Prosecution and the Appellant have both provided observations on this system.2
 The
Pre-Trial Chamber has given the parties until 2 May 2006 to submit their final
observations on the system of disclosure. The matters raised by the Appellant, and in
particular the scope of his entitlement to material either in the situation record or in the
Prosecution's possession or control, are thus squarely before the Pre-Trial Chamber.
16. While these issues are pending before the Pre-Trial Chamber, the Prosecution has
taken a liberal interpretation of the disclosure to which the Appellant is entitled at this
stage of proceedings. The Prosecution, despite its clear reservations about the interim
system of disclosure imposed by the Pre-Trial Chamber,27
 has already disclosed
material to the Appellant under both Articles 61 (3) (b) and 67 (2), and this disclosure
is ongoing.28
 However the Prosecution has not been in a position to provide
inspection pursuant to Rule 77, as it fundamentally objects to an obligation on parties
24
 Appellant's Brief, section 2.\. The precise scope of "this material" is not entirely clear. It may refer to all of
the Prosecutor's evidence (as implied by section 2.1); or to the subsequent assertion that "the defence has not
received the disclosure materials to which it is entitled ... it does not have the material on which Pre-Trial
Chamber I based its decision." (section 2.2); or to "full and unredacted disclosure of both the record of the
proceedings and the Prosecutor's record in the present case." (section 2.2)
"

System of Disclosure and Establishing an Interim System of Disclosure", ICC-01/04-01/06-54, 24 March 2006;

"Decision Convening a Hearing on the System of Disclosure for the Purposes of the Confirmation Hearing",
ICC-01/04-01/06-74, 10 April 2006.
27
 In particular, the Prosecution has strong reservations about the interim system of disclosure purporting to
require disclosure through the Registry, rather than directly to the defence. The Prosecution believes that
disclosure under the Statute is to take place directly between the parties. The Prosecution has therefore been
disclosing material directly to the Appellant, but has also communicated the material to the Pre-Trial Chamber
shortly thereafter (while reserving its right to take a different approach in future cases - see "Prosecution's
Observations on Disclosure", ICC-01/04-01/06-67-AnxA, 6 April 2006, at para. 8 and footnote 14).
28
 To date, the Prosecution has disclosed two packages of potentially exculpatory materials and one package of
material pursuant to Article 61(3)(b), totalling 30 items. The Prosecution envisage further disclosure, including
further Article 61(3)(b) materials in near future, and ongoing disclosure of potentially exculpatory materials at
intervals of approximately two weeks.

to file with the Registrar material which is subject to inspection, as required by the
interim system of disclosure.29
17. Crucially, and as explained above, the Appellant already has access to all of the
documents and material that he requires for the purpose of the present appeal, namely
all of the material put before the Pre-Trial Chamber by the Prosecution for the
purposes of issuing the warrant of arrest, albeit in a formatted or redacted form.30
 The
Prosecution submits that the Appellant's insistence on obtaining unredacted versions
of these documents is unjustified.31
 As explained above, the redactions have been
made by the Prosecution and by the Pre-Trial Chamber pursuant to the Statute and the
Rules, and in order to protect legitimate interests such as the protection of victims and
witnesses.32
The admissibility issues raised by the Appellant
18. The Appellant claims that the Pre-Trial Chamber erred in its Decision as to the
admissibility of the case against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo. In particular, the Appellant
appears to consider that one of the pillars of the Chamber's finding of admissibility -
the different bases for the ICC and DRC arrests proceedings - was flawed, as no arrest
warrant was ever served on his client by the DRC authorities, a fact that in addition
casts doubts as to the legality of his arrest. On this basis alone, the Appellant seeks a
reversal of the Pre-Trial Chamber's findings on admissibility.
:9
 The Prosecution has made this position clear to both the Appellant and to the Pre-Trial Chamber (see "Filing
of Incriminating Evidence and Potentially Exculpatory Evidence", 1CC-01/04-01/06-64, 5 April 2006, at para. 6;
"Prosecution's Observations on Disclosure", ICC-01/04-01/06-67-AnxA, 6 April 2006, at para. 9). The
Prosecution has, however, provided to the Appellant a first list of documents falling within the parameters of
Rule 77 (see "Filing of Incriminating Evidence and Potentially Exculpatory Evidence", ICC-01/04-01/06-64, 5
April 2006, at para. 6), in order to facilitate inspection once this matter is resolved.
30
 See "Decision on the Application by the Duty Counsel for the Defence dated 20 March 2006", ICC-01/04-
01/06-50, 22 March 2006, at pp. 2-3 stating that "the following documents ... are currently accessible to duty
counsel for the defence ... a formatted and/or redacted version of the filings of the Prosecution during the
application process for a warrant of arrest against Mr Thomas Lubanga Dyilo".
31
 The Prosecution has firmly maintained this position from the beginning - see Prosecution's Response, at paras.
5-6.
32
 The redacted versions of the documents and material to which the Appellant has access are in a coherent and
comprehensible form, and contain all of the relevant information to which the Appellant is entitled, i.e. not
necessarily names, places and dates. On the ongoing necessity of restrictions on disclosure and redaction of
statements, see "Prosecution's Observations on Disclosure", ICC-01/04-01/06-67-AnxA, 6 April 2006, at para.

19. The Prosecution in particular submits that the Appellant has misconstrued (a) the
nature of the decision taken by the Pre-Trial Chamber, and (b) the distinction between
domestic and ICC custodial proceedings.
(a) Nature of the decision taken by the Pre-Trial Chamber
20. The Appellant cites a finding made by the Chamber related to the admissibility of the
case against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, concluding that the Prosecution's general
statement pertaining to the DRC's authorities inability in the sense of Article 17 of the
Statute did not '"wholly correspond to the reality any longer".33
 The Prosecution, in its
Application, submitted that the case against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo would be
admissible because of the absence of any State taking action in relation to the crime
alleged. In support, the Prosecution offered the letter of referral from the DRC
authorities which, as the Chamber concurred, indicated that the DRC was "unable to
undertake the investigation and prosecution of crimes falling within the jurisdiction of
the Court".34
 The Chamber went on to note, nonetheless, that recent changes in the
DRC national judicial system suggested that a blanket statement on the inability of the
DRC judicial system may no longer be warranted. In particular, it noted the existence
of several domestically issued arrests against persons in the DRC for crimes that could
possibly fall within the jurisdiction of the Court.35
 However, as the Chamber further
held, the mere existence of domestic activity would be insufficient to avert
admissibility: for a case to be found inadmissible "national proceedings must
encompass both the person and the conduct which is the subject of the case before the
Court".36
21. The finding cited by the Appellant thus had a very confined scope: the Chamber did
not decide on matters such as the existence of a domestic arrest warrant, or the
contents of such warrant, as the Appellant appears to imply.
 7 Rather, in accordance
with the requirements of an admissibility assessment, the Chamber was confirming the
non-existence of any domestic proceedings against the person in question for the

10/13
crimes alleged by the Prosecution, a finding firmly supported by the information
provided to the Pre-Trial Chamber38
 and that the Appellant himself does not appear to
dispute. The Prosecution emphasizes that, as shown, no domestic proceedings
initiated against the Appellant cover the recruitment, conscription and use of child
soldiers, i.e. the substance of the present case. Those domestic proceedings, therefore,
cannot, under any circumstances, render the case against the Appellant inadmissible.
(b) Distinction between domestic and ICC custodial proceedings
22. The Appellant appears to suggest that alleged irregularities in detention of his client
prior to his transfer to the ICC can be heard before the Court. The Prosecution firstly
submits that the Appellant is neither bringing any evidence pertaining to this alleged
illegality, nor providing any specific details as to its form or scope. Rather, the
Appellant appears to be arguing, with no clearly identifiable basis, that there is a
"possibility" that his arrest by the DRC authorities - prior to any ICC intervention -
was illegal, presumably under DRC law.39
 The Prosecution respectfully submits that
the Appeals Chamber should not be asked to decide on "possibilities" or speculative
arguments of any kind. Moreover, the Prosecution stresses that any participant
bringing an appeal before this Chamber has a burden to clearly spell out the legal and
factual basis for the grounds of appeal he or she is raising, as well as to indicate the
relevant sources of information substantiating the factual allegations contained therein,
as required by Regulation 64 (2).
23. In addition, the Prosecution notes that (a) an alleged illegality tainting arrest
procedures would arguably be relevant vis-à-vis the exercise of jurisdiction over the
relevant person by the Court, and not admissibility; and (b) as the pertinent case law
illustrates, the prior detention of an accused person may be attributable to an
international tribunal, and thus subject to a challenge before it, only if it can be shown
that the person had been held in the custody of the tribunal - i.e. at its request or
38
 The Prosecution made it clear during the 2 February 2006 hearing that the charges contained in the domestic
DRC warrants of arrest were distinct from the charges against the Appellant in this case (''Redacted Version of
the Transcripts of the Hearing Held on 2 February 2006 and Certain Materials Presented During that Hearing",
ICC-01/04-01/06-48, 22 March 2006 at pp. 9-10; pp. 5-6 of transcript). The Prosecution further confirmed that
to the best of its knowledge no other country was investigating the Appellant for the crimes in this case (ibid, at
p. 13; p. 9 of transcript).

direction.40
 Moreover, on assessing relevant remedies, the fact of an irregularity in the
surrender process would not of itself be sufficient to exclude jurisdiction, but would
need to be balanced against a series of relevant factors.41
24. In the present case, neither the Prosecution nor the Pre-Trial Chamber was at any stage
involved in domestic proceedings relating to the arrest and detention of Thomas
Lubanga Dyilo prior to the issuance of the arrest warrant by the Chamber and the
transmission to the DRC authorities by the Registrar of the Court of the request for the
arrest and surrender of the Appellant. The basis and/or legality of his arrest and
detention in the DRC prior to this date, therefore, are not matters that can be properly
heard before this Court.
25. The Prosecution further notes that the Appellant has at his disposal, as part of the
record accessible to him, a detailed and documented account of the arrest and
surrender procedures followed pursuant to the arrest warrant by the Pre-Trial Chamber
and the request for arrest and surrender transmitted to the DRC authorities.42
 That
record provides no support whatsoever for any allegation of unlawfulness pertaining to
the specific procedure of arrest and surrender to the Court of the Appellant, and none
has been raised by the Appellant.
Conclusion
26. The Prosecution respectfully submits that, for the reasons explained above, the appeal
brought by the Appellant under Article 82 (1) (a) must necessarily fail. As noted at the
beginning of this response, the Prosecution is of the view that this appeal was a
premature step, and that instead of rushing to file a document containing vague and
unsubstantiated allegations before the Appeals Chamber, the Appellant should have
examined the Decision and the record and decided whether to make a challenge to the
admissibility of the case under Article 19, as he was entitled to.

27. In this sense, the Appeals Chamber may wish to consider re-directing the Appellant to
the Pre-Trial Chamber and to the available remedies which the Appellant may resort to
if he considers, having looked at the Decision and the related materials available to the
Appellant, that the case against him is inadmissible. Whereas the Prosecution's
position ordinarily would be that by choosing to bring an appeal under Article 82(1)
(a) an accused person is making use of his or her opportunity to challenge
admissibility, as prescribed by Article 19 (4), and that any subsequent attempt to do so
would require special leave and a showing of exceptional circumstances,4
 the
Prosecution submits that in the particular circumstances of this case the fairest position
is the one described at the beginning of this paragraph. The Court is a novel institution,
its procedures are being used for the first time in this case and a number of provisions
in its basic documents require further clarification by means of judicial interpretation.
In this particular context, the Appellant should not be deprived of an opportunity to
fully and meaningfully litigate the admissibility of the case against him, if he considers
that such litigation is warranted, merely because he initially chose the wrong avenue.44
28. The Prosecution accordingly requests the Appeals Chamber to:
(a) Reject the Appellant's request for an extension of time; and
(b) Reject the Appellant's alternative request to overturn the Pre-Trial Chamber's
Decision and to declare the case against Thomas Lubanga Dyilo inadmissible.
