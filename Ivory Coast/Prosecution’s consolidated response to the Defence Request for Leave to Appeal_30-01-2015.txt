Introduction
1. The Defence’s request for leave to appeal (“Application”)1 the “Decision on the
Legal Representative of Victims’ access to certain confidential filings and to the case
record” (“Decision”)2 should be rejected. None of the eight alleged issues (“Issues”)
raised by the Defence constitute appealable “issues” within the terms of article
82(1)(d) of the Rome Statute (“Statute”), nor do they arise from the Decision. Many of
them constitute mere disagreements with the Decision, and represent the Defence’s
conflicting opinions and continued insistence on particular positions—despite ample
indication to the contrary. Moreover, the Issues do not meet the criteria for leave to
appeal.
2. Equally, the Defence request for suspensive effect of the Decision3 is unfounded
and should be dismissed.
Submissions
I. Response to the Application for Leave to Appeal
3. The Appeals Chamber has ruled that “only an issue may form the subject-matter
of an appealable decision. […] An issue is constituted by a subject the resolution of
which is essential for the determination of matters arising in the judicial cause under
examination.”4 Mere disagreements or conflicting opinions are not appealable.5 None
of the Issues identified by the Defence meet this test.

(a) The First Issue is not appealable and does not arise from the Decision
4. The First Issue—namely, whether the Single Judge, instead of the Trial Chamber,
could decide to provide the Legal Representative of Victims (“LRV”) with access to
the documents6—is not appealable. It concerns a routine trial management issue
unrelated to the Decision’s subject matter, and as such is not “a subject the resolution
of which is essential for the determination of matters arising in the judicial cause
under examination.” To the extent that the First Issue relates to the LRV’s access to
the six listed documents, it does not also arise from this Decision, but, at least in part,
from an earlier decision by the Single Judge on 20 November 2014.7
5. Firstly, the Issue is based on an incomplete review and misunderstanding of the
statutory framework. As the sole support for its argument, the Defence relies on rule
132bis(6) of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence (“Rules”).8 It neglects review of the
remainder of rule 132bis, which lists out the areas of the Single Judge’s competence in
a non-exhaustive manner. Indeed, as rule 132bis(2) states, a Single Judge “shall take
all necessary preparatory measures in order to facilitate the fair and expeditious
conduct of the trial proceedings, in consultation with the Trial Chamber.”9 Further,
the Single Judge is competent to decide preparatory issues including “ensuring
proper disclosure between the parties”, “dealing with applications by victims for
participation in the trial, as referred to in article 68, paragraph 3” and “dealing with
any other preparatory matters that must be resolved which do not otherwise fall within
the exclusive competence of the Trial Chamber.”10 Granting the LRV access to certain
confidential documents is one such preparatory issue relating to routine trial
management that the Single Judge is competent to decide upon. In any event, rule
132bis(2) makes clear that the Single Judge takes these preparatory measures in
consultation with the Trial Chamber (emphasis added). The Application fails to
acknowledge the existence of any of these relevant provisions.
6 Application, paras.14-17. 7 ICC-02/11-01/11-724 (“Decision of 20 November 2014”). 8 Application, para.15. 9 Rule 132bis(2). 10 Rules 132bis(5)(a), 5(c) and 5(g) (emphasis added).

No. ICC-02/11-01/11 5/16 30 January 2015
6. Further, although the Application references rule 132bis(6), it fails to elaborate
how the Decision “significantly affects the rights of the accused.” Apart from its
claim that “cette décision est susceptible d’attenter à l’équité de la procédure en ce qu’elle
constitue une nouvelle partie dans la procédure aux côtes de l’Accusation et de la Défense“,11
it offers no further justification. Such unsupported assertions can neither advance
claims of an appealable issue, nor do they show any impact on the fairness of the
proceedings. Its submission that the Decision “redefines” victims’ rights is similarly
unsubstantiated in the context of the First Issue. 12 Contrary to the Defence
argument,13 the Single Judge’s approach has previously been adopted by several
Trial Chambers as a routine trial management issue.14 The Decision does not suggest
anything new.
7. Secondly, the Single Judge’s competence to allow the LRV access to the listed
documents first arose in the Decision of 20 November 2014. There, the Single Judge
directed the Registry to notify the documents in question to the LRV, “unless the
Prosecution and the Defence provide reasons for the chosen classification pursuant to
Regulation 23bis of the Regulations[…]”.15 The Decision in question is only a follow
up to the Decision of 20 November 2014, upon receiving the parties’ observations. As
such, the Single Judge’s competence to allow the LRV access to the six confidential
documents does not arise from this Decision.
8. For these reasons, the First Issue should be dismissed.
(b) The Second Issue does not arise from the Decision and is not appealable
9. The Second Issue—whether the Single Judge erred in allowing the LRV access to
confidential documents when the Rules explicitly state that the victims’ right of
access is limited by confidentiality16—does not arise from the Decision. Nor does it
11 Application, para.16. 12 Application, para.16. 13 Contra Application, paras.8-10. 14 ICC-01/09-01/11-460 (“Ruto Decision”), paras.64-69; ICC-01/09-02/11-498 (“Kenyatta Decision, paras.63- 68; ICC-01/04-01/07-1788-tENG (“Katanga Decision”), paras.118-123; ICC-01/04-01/06-1119 (“Lubanga
Decision”), paras.105-107; ICC-01/05-01/08-807-Corr (“Bemba Decision”), para.47. 15 Decision of 20 November 2014, p.4. 16 Application, para.18-25.

No. ICC-02/11-01/11 6/16 30 January 2015
raise any appealable issue. Yet again, the Defence fails to properly acknowledge the
law the Decision relies on, and misunderstands the relevant statutory provisions
governing victims’ access to confidential documents. 10. Contrary to its claim that “[i]l n’existe […] pas de base légale à la décision de principe
prise par le Juge Unique “,17 the very statutory provisions the Decision references (rules
131(2) and 92(5))—and the Defence acknowledges—provide the legal basis. Indeed,
rule 131(2) allows the victims or their legal representatives participating in the
proceedings pursuant to rules 89 to 91 access to the record “subject to any restrictions
concerning confidentiality and the protection of national security information”.18 The
Defence wrongly appears to suggest that the phrase “subject to any restrictions
concerning confidentiality” implies that the LRV can never access confidential
material. This cannot be—as a matter of logic.
11. Likewise, the Application wrongly interprets rule 92(5). While it claims that rule
92(5) does not accord victims access to the documents of the parties, 19 the plain
statutory text shows otherwise. It provides specifically that participating victims and
their legal representatives shall be notified of inter alia “[r]equests, submissions,
motions and other documents relating to such requests, submissions or motions.”20 It
remains unclear from the Application why documents emanating from the parties
would not be covered by this formulation.21 Neither does the Defence explain this in
any detail. As shown above, rule 92(5)—along with rule 131(2)—has been
consistently used to grant victims access to confidential material on the record.22
12. For the same reason, contrary to the Defence claim, the Decision’s reliance on
these statutory provisions does not constitute “une nouvelle approche”.23 The issue of
the LRV’s access to the confidential documents of the case record is not new to this
17 Application, para.25. 18 Rule 131(2). See Decision, para.15. 19 Application, para.22. 20 Rule 92(5)(b). 21 But see paras.15-17. 22 See Ruto Decision, paras.64-69; Kenyatta Decision, paras.63-68; Katanga Decision, paras.118-123. But see
paras.15-17. 23 Application, para.19.

Court.24 Further, the Defence only speculates that the Decision held generally that the
principle of “personal interests” no longer determined the question of access.25 Given
that the Decision clearly references case law articulating this principle,26 the Defence
submission is wrong. The Defence only partially references the Lubanga Decision:
contrary to the Defence submission,27 that decision recognised inter alia that victims
could access confidential filings of material relevant to their personal interests.28
13. In sum, the Second Issue rests on a skewed, speculative and unsupported
interpretation of this Court’s statutory provisions and law. It does not therefore arise
from the Decision. Additionally, the Defence in essence disagrees with the Court’s
statutory text and practice. But mere disagreement, and offering alternative
interpretations contrary to established interpretation, does not amount to an
appealable issue.
14. For these reasons, the Second Issue should be dismissed.
(c) The Third Issue does not arise from the Decision
15. The Third Issue—namely, whether the Single Judge erred in allowing the LRV
access to “inter-partes rule 77 documents not accessible by e-Court”
29—does not arise
from the Decision. The Issue identified by the Defence is more apparent than real.
The Decision did not grant the LRV access to any inter-partes documents or material,
including rule 77 documents. Rule 77 documents are not part of the record of the
case. Although it may appear that the term “Ringtail” used in the Decision is
ambiguous, in fact, the Prosecution understands that the Decision only grants the
LRV access to E-Court. The Prosecution wishes to clarify that it understands the
reference to “Ringtail” in paragraphs 15 and 20 of the Decision to mean “E-Court”—
24 Contra Application, para.19. 25 Application, para.19. 26 Decision, para.15, citing to Ruto Decision, para.67; Kenyatta Decision, para.66. 27 Application, para.24. 28 Lubanga Decision, paras.106-107. But see paras.15-17. 29 Application, paras.26-29.

No. ICC-02/11-01/11 8/16 30 January 2015
and not the parties’ own Ringtail.30 To the extent that the Decision relies on case law
from other Chambers, the Prosecution understands those references similarly.31 As E- Court contains the record of the case, the Single Judge provided the LRV access to it
under rules 92(5) and 131(2). Therefore, the Issue does not arise from the Decision
because the LRV was not granted access in the terms the Issue suggests. The Defence
arguments in that respect must therefore fail.32
16. If ever documents relevant to rule 77 disclosures were to be uploaded to E- Court—which is not currently the case—they then become part of the record. The
Defence’s apparent suggestion that rule 77 documents are limited to its use 33 is
therefore both premature and incorrect. Moreover, to the extent that this relates to
the Office of the Prosecutor’s (“Prosecution”) own documents listed, 34 the
Prosecution—as the filing party—had no objection to the LRV’s access to the three
documents—as the Single Judge has already recognised.35 This is not a matter for the
Defence to determine. 17. For these reasons, the Third Issue should be dismissed.
(d) The Fourth Issue does not arise from the Decision and is not appealable
18. The Fourth Issue, as to whether the Single Judge erred in providing the LRV
access without considering the “personal interests” of the victims, does not arise
from the Decision. The Application fails to read the Decision—and the supporting
case law—as a whole.
19. Contrary to the Defence argument, 36 the Single Judge in effect considered if
providing the LRV access was in the victims’ interests, i.e., it would allow for their
30 Ringtail is a software. The parties have their own Ringtail evidence databases. The Chamber has access to the
evidence of the parties via E-Court which uses the Ringtail software. 31 See for example, Ruto Decision, para.69; Kenyatta Decision, para.68; Katanga Decision, paras.122-123. Note
in particular the Katanga Chamber’s reference to “[…] the Ringtail system, which is maintained by the Registry
and accessible to the Chamber” (para.123). 32 Application, paras.26-27. 33 Application, para.29. 34 Decision, paras.4-5,12-13,16. 35 Decision, para.12. 36 Application, paras.30-32.

No. ICC-02/11-01/11 9/16 30 January 2015
effective participation. 37 Firstly, the Decision carefully references prior case law,
including the Ruto Decision, which allowed the Common Legal Representative access
to confidential filings, to the extent that their content is relevant to the victims’
personal interests, and to allow meaningful victim participation.38 The Single Judge
was therefore fully aware of this consideration. He then in effect assessed that it was
in the victims’ interests for the LRV to have access to the case record including
confidential filings. In his view, that would ensure effective victims’ participation.39
Although paragraph 15 of the Decision does not expressly use the term “personal
interests”, the Single Judge in fact conducted the very same assessment as the trial
practice he relies on. Equally, the Single Judge considered that the LRV had a general
right of access to and timely notification of the record under rules 131(2) and 92(5).40
Secondly, by limiting access to the LRV at this stage, the Single Judge deferred the
assessment of each individual victim’s interests to a time when the victim should
request access. 41 Given that individual victims had not yet sought access, no
individual determinations were necessary at this stage. The Defence continues to
disagree with the practice of various Trial Chambers, but such conflicting opinions
are not appealable.
20. For these reasons, the Fourth Issue should be dismissed.
(e) The Fifth Issue does not arise from the Decision and is not appealable
21. As its Fifth Issue, the Defence claims that the Single Judge erred in artificially
differentiating between the LRV and the victims. It argues, generally, that the Judge
misinterpreted the statutory role and function of the LRV.42 However, this Fifth Issue
does not arise from the Decision. Additionally, it is a mere disagreement with the
existing law and practice reflected in the Decision, and thus is not appealable.
37 Decision, paras.15, 20, fn.21. 38 See Decision, para.15, citing Ruto Decision, para.67; Kenyatta Decision, para.66. 39 Decision, paras.15, 20, fn.21. 40 Decision, paras.15, 20. 41 Decision, para.15. 42 Application, paras.34-36.

No. ICC-02/11-01/11 10/16 30 January 2015
22. Firstly, the Defence wrongly compares the relationship between the Defence and
the accused, and the LRV and the victims.43 The former is a party to the proceedings,
the latter—as the Decision recognised44—is a participant. Therefore its effort to argue
that the Decision created a “false dichotomy” between the LRV and the victims45 on
this basis is without merit, because its starting premise is incorrect.
23. Secondly, at this Court, confidential information is routinely limited only to the
LRV and to the Office of Public Counsel for Victims (“OPCV”).46 As the Decision
notes, the LRV is bound by the Code of Professional Conduct for counsel. 47
Accordingly, the LRV—similar to inter alia defence counsel—is expected to respect
and actively exercise all care to ensure respect for professional secrecy and the
confidentiality of information in accordance with the Statute, the Rules and the
Regulations of the Court.48 The LRV may only disclose such information where inter
alia such disclosure is ordered by the Court.49 On this basis, the Single Judge directed
that the victims’ access to the case record was limited to the LRV only. All further
requests for access by individual victims must be approved on a case by case basis.50
Merely because the Defence disagrees with this practice, and in effect the Decision,
does not make this appealable. Conflicting opinions do not warrant leave to appeal.
24. For these reasons, the Fifth Issue should be dismissed.
(f) The Sixth Issue does not arise from the Decision and is not appealable
25. The Defence’s Sixth Issue is barely expressed. In a single sentence, the Defence
appears to claim that the Single Judge erred in artificially distinguishing between the
LRV and the other representatives of victims, contrary to the Statute and logic.51 No
further elaboration of the matter, nor attempt to meet the article 82(1)(d) criteria is

See also Article 1, Code of Professional Conduct for counsel. 48 Article 8(1), Code of Professional Conduct for counsel. 49 Article 8(4), Code of Professional Conduct for counsel. 50 Decision, para.15. 51 Application, para.37.

No. ICC-02/11-01/11 11/16 30 January 2015
made. Such unsubstantiated submissions should not be entertained, and should be
dismissed in limine. 26. In any event, this alleged Issue does not arise from the Decision. The Decision
only concerns the LRV, and does not refer to any “other representatives of victims”.
Further, the Defence submission fails to identify any particular finding that may be
relevant to this Issue. It is therefore purely based on conjecture, and raises only
hypothetical questions. This cannot constitute an identifiable subject essential for the
determination of the matter (an appealable issue). 27. For these reasons, the Sixth Issue should be dismissed.
(g) The Seventh Issue does not arise from the Decision and is not
appealable
28. As its Seventh Issue, the Defence argues that the Single Judge erred in abolishing
the difference between the parties and the LRV in effect.52 The Seventh Issue does not
arise from the Decision because the Defence misreads it. Further, it is a mere
continued disagreement with the Single Judge’s findings, and therefore not
appealable.
29. The Defence wrongly claims that the Decision considered the LRV as a party to
the proceedings.53 The Single Judge did not do that. Instead, the Decision states
“[t]hough the victims are not parties to the proceedings, they are participants who
are expressly entitled to be notified by the Registrar in a timely manner of, among
other things, requests, submissions, motions and documents that form part of the
proceedings.”54 The Single Judge clearly recognised the victims’ role as participants,
and not parties. The Seventh Issue does not refer to this finding. Because it misreads
the Decision, the Seventh Issue is flawed and does not arise from the Decision.
52 Application, paras.38-40. 53 Application, para.38. 54 Decision, para.15.

No. ICC-02/11-01/11 12/16 30 January 2015
Moreover, as submitted in response to the Third Issue,55 the LRV was not granted
access in the terms the Defence suggests.
30. In addition, the Seventh Issue continues to disagree with the Single Judge’s
finding rejecting the Defence position that the victims are third parties. 56 It also
apparently disagrees with the understanding of “ex parte” classifications. 57 Such
disagreements or conflicting opinions are not appealable.
31. For these reasons, the Seventh Issue should be dismissed.
(h) The Eighth Issue does not arise from the Decision and is not appealable
32. As its Eighth Issue, the Defence claims that the Single Judge erred by allowing the
LRV access to documents covered by medical secrecy and privacy without the
person’s consent.58 The Eighth Issue does not arise from the Decision, because it
appears to erroneously assume that the Decision by granting the LRV confidential
access in effect allowed all victims such access.59 It is also not appealable because it
only disagrees with the Decision, often without substantiation.
33. The Decision did not grant all victims access to confidential medical documents.
As the Decision states in plain terms, access to any documents (including those
related to medical issues) is restricted to the LRV alone. Individual victims may be
granted access only on a case-by-case basis, when the Single Judge approves.60 As
such, and because the LRV is equally bound by the dictates of confidentiality, the
Decision does not raise any purported issues of violations of medical secrecy and
privacy.61 The Application misunderstands the Single Judge’s finding and so, this
Issue does not arise from the Decision.
55 See paras.15-17. 56 Application, para.39. 57 Application, paras.38-39. 58 Application, paras.41-47. 59 Contra Application, para.43. 60 Decision, paras.15, 19-21, fn.21. 61 Decision, para.22.

No. ICC-02/11-01/11 13/16 30 January 2015
34. Equally, the Defence disagrees with the Single Judge’s findings on ICC-02/11- 01/11-697-Conf (a document containing certain medical information). 62 This
disagreement and conflicting opinion is not appealable.63 In any event, the Defence’s
disagreement is unfounded. Firstly, it incorrectly claims that the Single Judge did not
verify if the medical information contained in ICC-02/11-01/11-697-Conf was already
made public.64 However, in footnote 22 of the Decision, the Single Judge provides, by
way of example, no less than four filings where such information was made public.65
Thus, the Single Judge’s finding that public decisions of Pre-Trial Chamber I and
public Defence filings already revealed much of the redacted medical information in
ICC-02/11-01/11-697-Conf was well supported and verified. Indeed, the medical
information contained in ICC-02/11-01/11-697-Conf is already available in the public
domain.66 Accordingly, any argument that the Defence may have on the purported
violation of medical secrecy is both wrong and without impact.
35. Secondly, the Defence incorrectly claims that the Single Judge could not rely on
the Pre-Trial Chamber’s Decision on Mr Gbagbo’s fitness to take part in the Court’s
proceedings (ICC-02/11-01/11-286-Red) as “precedent” to allow the LRV access to the
medical information. It claims, without support, that “experts” had advised the
Court that the content of medical reports should not be disclosed to third parties.67
This argument is flawed. While it is unclear from the Application which particular
expert view it refers to, no matter that, the LRV is not a “third party”. The Defence’s
challenge to the Single Judge’s use of this Pre-Trial Chamber decision is thus wrong.
In any case, the Defence does not find fault with the Single Judge’s reliance on the
three other public filings—all of which reveal to the public at large the allegedly
confidential information the Defence now seeks to shield from the LRV.
62 Application, paras.43-47. 63 ICC-01/04-168 OA3, para.9. 64 Application, para.45. 65 See Decision, para.21, fn.22. 66 Compare for example, ICC-02/11-01/11-697-Conf, para.42 with ICC-02/11-01/11-286-Red, paras. 28, 36, 66,

36. Thirdly, the Defence seems to argue on principle that medical, private
information of the accused, and that covered by professional secrecy, should be
restricted from the victims. 68 This submission lacks any further detail. Moreover,
purely hypothetical questions, not grounded in the Decision, are not appealable. It is
not an identifiable subject or topic requiring a decision for resolution.69
37. For these reasons, the Eighth Issue should be dismissed.
(i) The Application fails to meet the article 82(1)(d) criteria for leave to
appeal
38. The Defence fails to demonstrate that the eight alleged Issues have any impact on
the fairness of the proceedings. It wrongly assumes that the Single Judge effectively
treated the victims as parties.70 As shown above,71 the Decision does not support such
a reading. Likewise, as also demonstrated,72 the Single Judge considered the victims’
interests. Additionally, the Defence seems to claim unfairness because it will be
required to use its time and resources to “préparer des soumissions sur ces questions.”73
Preparing relevant submissions is an expected and routine part of counsel’s
workload, it cannot affect the fairness of the proceedings in any manner. The Defence
further speculates that giving the LRV access will allow her to develop strategies
based on documents not used by the parties.74 Without any concrete references on
how this may be so, this assertion remains hypothetical and hence unfounded. 75
Moreover, that the LRV fulfils her statutory role cannot impact the fairness of the
proceedings in any manner.
39. In any case, the Decision built in ample safeguards to the LRV’s access. First, any
access to the listed documents, and to the case record, was limited to the LRV.
Individual victims can only access the record when specifically approved by the
68 Application, para.47. 69 ICC-01/04-168 OA3, para.9. 70 Application, para.48. 71 See paras.28-31. 72 See paras.18-20. 73 Application, para.49. 74 Application, para.50. 75 See paras.15-17. The Decision did not grant the LRV access to any inter-partes material.

Single Judge on a case by case basis. Second, the LRV continues to be bound by the
Code of Professional Conduct for counsel vis-à-vis confidential information. Third,
the parties continue to retain the opportunity to classify particular filings as
confidential and ex parte if they are of the view that the LRV should not access them.76
40. The Defence argument on the impact on expedition of proceedings is also without
merit. 77 That there may be several or numerous applications to participate from
individual victims cannot, at this stage, be a reason to grant leave to appeal. The
Defence’s concern is hypothetical and speculative. The Defence does not argue any
purported impact on the outcome of the proceedings.
41. The Defence claims that appellate intervention is required to harmonise the
approaches of different Chambers, to correct the trial of error, and to protect defence
strategy from the victims.78 However, as shown above, since all the Issues result from
a misreading of the Decision in whole or in part, the Appeals Chamber is not
required to correct a party’s misunderstanding. Neither is the Appeals Chamber an
advisory body on purely hypothetical matters.79 The Application fails to demonstrate
why the Appeals Chamber would be required, at this stage, to reinterpret the clear
statutory framework, or compensate for any failure to acknowledge existing law or
practice. 42. For all these reasons, the Defence fails to meet the criteria for leave to appeal.
II. Response to the Request for Suspensive Effect of the Decision
43. The Defence request for “suspensive effect” of the Decision80 is unfounded. As the
LRV has correctly noted,81 the Court’s statutory framework does not permit requests
for suspensive effect before Trial Chambers. Only the Appeals Chamber may
76 Decision, para.15. 77 Application, paras.51-53. 78 Application, paras.54-57. 79 ICC-01/04-503 OA4 OA5 OA6, para.30. 80 ICC-02/11-01/11-753 (“Request” or “Request for Suspensive Effect”). 81 ICC-02/11-01/11-754, paras.8-10, 14.

No. ICC-02/11-01/11 16/16 30 January 2015
entertain such requests once it is seised of an appeal, pursuant to article 82(3).82 The
Defence request for suspensive effect before the Trial Chamber therefore fails.
44. Even if the Request were read as a request to stay the Decision, it remains
unfounded. The Trial Chamber should not stay the Decision as the Application—the
effect of which the Defence seeks to preserve—is equally without merit. As
demonstrated above, the Application is based on a wrong reading of the Decision
and speculation.83 Moreover, as the effect of the Decision is limited to the LRV alone,
there is no prejudice whatsoever.
Conclusion
45. The Defence neither demonstrates that the Issues are appealable, nor that they
meet the standard for leave to appeal under article 82(1)(d). For this reason, the
Application should be dismissed.
46. As the Request for Suspensive Effect is unfounded in law and fact, it should be
dismissed.
