Pursuant to Pre‐Trial III’s order of 24 January 2012,2 the Prosecution provided the

the Chamber on 27 March 2012.3

 Consistent with the agreement between the Prosecution and the Defence, the Prosecution provided the element
based Chart which shall not be understood as a limitation for the Prosecution for its use of the evidence referred
to in the annex for the purpose of the confirmation hearing. Neither does it limit the Chamber’s power to freely
assess all the evidence before it.
