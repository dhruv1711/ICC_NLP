1. The Office of the Prosecutor (“Prosecution” or “OTP”) respectfully submits its
List of Witnesses and List of Evidence to be relied upon at trial.1 The List of
Witnesses is provided in confidential Annex A to this submission and the List of
Evidence in confidential Annex B. Confidentiality level
2. The Prosecution requests that annexes A and B be received as confidential since
they both contain the names and identifying information of witnesses and relate
to evidentiary material that is currently to be treated as confidential.
Submission
3. The Prosecution currently intends to rely on 101 witnesses at trial. The
Prosecution expects to be able to reduce this number after having had the
opportunity to discuss agreements as to the evidence with the Defence.2 By way
of example, nine witnesses are currently on the list, solely for the purposes of
establishing the conditions of collection and chain of custody of documents the
Prosecution intends to submit as evidence.
4. The Prosecution’s List of Witnesses is submitted with the metadata as mandated
by the e-Court Protocol, 3 with the exception of the “Appearance” and the
“Expected Appearance length” fields. The necessary information to populate
these two fields depends on a number of variables that are currently unknown to
the Prosecution such as, among others, if the Defence will agree to certain facts,
the length of time the Parties will have to present their case, and whether certain
witnesses will testify in person, by video-link or in situ.
1 See order ICC-02/11-01/11-723, para.10. 2 Pursuant to rule 69 of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence (“Rules”). 3 Unified Technical protocol ("E-court Protocol") for the provision of evidence, witness and victims information
in electronic form, 24 January 2012, ICC-02/11-01/11-30-AnxI, pp.21-23.

5. The Prosecution also provides notice that in relation to the witness highlighted in
yellow in Annex A, the Prosecution is in the process of evaluating whether the
witness is fit to testify.
6. The Prosecution’s List of Evidence currently contains 3817 items of evidence. This
list is also being submitted prior to the Prosecution having had the opportunity to
hold discussions with the Defence as to possible agreed facts which could greatly
reduce the number of documents.
7. The Prosecution submits that both lists are subject to limited change within the
parameters of the separate request being filed concurrently pursuant to
regulation 35 of the Regulations of the Court. Further, the Prosecution takes this
opportunity to reiterate that focused investigations in the case of The Prosecutor v. Charles Blé Goudé are ongoing and has sought to join the Blé Goudé case with the
Gbagbo case.4 Notwithstanding the above, both lists contain the near totality of the
evidence the Prosecution intends to rely on at trial and therefore provide the
Defence with ample notice to prepare itself for trial. With this filing, the Defence
is in possession of all the material evidence on which the Prosecution intends to
rely; any future additions will be corroborative in nature, ancillary documents, or
evidence that is uncovered in the natural course of its ongoing investigations.
