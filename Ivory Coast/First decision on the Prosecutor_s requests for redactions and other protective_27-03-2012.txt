12. On 20 March 2012, an ex parte hearing^^ with the Prosecutor and the VWU
was held before the Single Judge, during which clarifications and update on
witnesses' situations were submitted.''^
B. Parties'' stibmissions
(i) The Prosecutor's requests
a) First and Second Requests for Redactions
13. The First Request for Redactions seeks authorisation to redact, pursuant to
Rule 81(2) of the Rules: (i) the identity of all Prosecution staff members
mentioned in the relevant documents; (ii) the identity of translators and
interpreters; (iii) the date and location of interviews; and (iv) any information
identifying Prosecution sources. The Prosecutor contends that the redactions
sought do not relate to information that is relevant for the preparation of the
Defence case and that revealing such information is likely to have implications
on its resources and ability to conduct the investigations expeditiously.^^
14. The Prosecutor also seeks authorisation to redact, pursuant to Rule 81(4) of
the Rules: (i) identifying information of third parties at risk on account of the
activities of the Court; (ii) identifying information of family members of any
witnesses; and (iii) information relevant to locate low-profile witnesses as it
might put their family at risk, submitting that it would not have any impact on
the fairness of the proceedings.^^
15. The Prosecutor further requests the redaction of the metadata of 149
documents in relation to (i) the identity of Prosecution staff members; and (ii)
15ICC-02/01-01/11-65 and its confidential ex parte annex.

information relating to the date of interviews,^^ as well as the lifting of other
redactions, subject to the adoption by the Chamber of a protocol regulating the
use of confidential information during investigations.^^
b) Request for Protective Measures
16. The Request for Protective Measures seeks, pursuant to Article 68(1) of the
Rome Statute ("Statute") and Rule 81(4) of the Rules, a delay until 16 May 2012
for the disclosure of statements of witnesses 54 and 108.^^ In addition, pursuant
to Article 68(5) of the Statute and Rule 81(5) of the Rules, the Prosecutor requests
to withhold the identity and statements of witnesses 47 and 49 and instead to
stibmit anonymous summaries.^^ At the ex parte hearing held on 20 March 2012,
the Prosecutor submitted fu:rther information on the particular situation of each
of these witnesses.
17.. The Prosecutor contends that these protective measures do not cause any
undue prejudice to the Defence since the evidence of witnesses 47, 49, 54 and 108
is merely used to corroborate other evidence that will be disclosed to the Defence
at an earlier stage.^^
c) . Request for variation of time limit to disclose incriminating evidence
18. The Prosecutor informs the Chamber that two items - an open source video
recording and a written transcript of a previously disclosed recording, which
were collected between 25 October 2011 and 24 January 2012 - were not
disclosed to the Defence in compliance with the Disclosure Decision due to an

oversight by the Prosecutor in the review of his database. ^"^ Accordingly, he
requests an extension of time for the disclosure of the items of evidence in
question.25
d) Request for variation of time limit to subm.it requests for redactions
19. The Prosecutor submits that due to an oversight from his Office, 15
docLiments were not included in the Second Request for Redactions. The
Prosecutor explains this oversight in light of the fact that his Office undertook the
review of its entire database up to 15 February 2012. Such review comprised
more that 1,500 documents.^^
20. . The Prosecutor appended to his requests for a variation of time limit his
actual requests for redactions to the 15 omitted documents.
(ii) The Defence Observations
21. The Defence opposes the proposed redactions as being requested on a
systematic and not on a case-by-case basis.^^The Defence submits that the First
Request for Redactions was filed after the deadline^^ and that it had not been
duly informed „of the filing of the Requests for Redactions and of their
underlying legal and factual basis, in accordance with the Decision on
Disclosure.^^
22. In particular, the Defence contends that any redaction of a Prosecution staff
member's identity, based on Rule 81(2) of the Rules, should be objectively

justified and not systematic, since the use of anonymous prosecutors violates its
right to a fair trial It argues that the identification of staff members present
during the interviews is a key guarantee of procedural propriety in the taking of
the statements. Less intrusive alternative measures should have been sought and
the logistical reasons given by the Prosecutor should be rejected.^^
23. For the same reasons, the Defence submits that an unrestricted redaction of
ke)^ elements such as the identifying information of translators, interpreters^\and
Prosecutor sources,^^ as well as the date and location of interviews,^^ would be
prejudicial to their own investigations.
24. The Defence equally opposes the systematic redaction, based on Rule 81(4)
of the Rules, of identifying information of third parties at risk, ^"^ of family
members of any witnesses^^ and of information relevant to locate lov/-profile
witnesses,^^ as the risk has to be objectively justified on a case-b5^-case basis,
balancing the various interests at stake.^^

III. Analysis ^nà conclusions of the Single Judge
A. Issues of compliance by the Prosecutor zvith the time limits established in
the Decision on Disclosure
26. In its response to the First Request for Redactions, the Defence notes that
although dated 10 February 2012, the First Request for Redactions was notified to
the Defence only on 13 February 2012, and appears to have been registered in the
record of the case on that same ddij?^ The Defence therefore prays that the First
Request for Redactions be rejected as out of time.^^
27. The information available indicates that the First Request for Redactions
was filed on 10 February 2012 at 17.08, outside of the working hours of the
Registry. In line with Regulation 24 of the Regulations of the Registry, the
document was registered in the case record and notified to the parties the next
working day, 13 February 2012. The Single Judge agrees with the Defence that
the First Request for Redactions was not filed in compliance with the time limit
imposed by the Judge in the Decision on Disclosure.'^^
28. However, the Single Judge, recalling the Decision on Disclosure,^^ notes that
specific time limits for the submission of redaction requests to the Chamber were
set in order for the Defence to have evidence disclosed as soon as possible and on
an ongoing basis. Although the parties are under obligation to comply with such
time limits, the latter do not have preclusive effect with respect, to the parties'
ability to seek protective measures or to rely on evidence at the confirmation of
charges hearing. Any consequences of non-compliance with time limits for
disclosure are to be determined by the Chamber, within its powers and

obligations in relation to the disclosure process, as provided for by Article 61(3)
of the Statute and Rule 121(2) of the Rules. In the present case, the Single Judge
does not consider it proportionate that the minor delay on the part of the
Prosecutor should lead to a rejection of the First Request for Redactions.
29. On the basis of the foregoing, the Single Judge is of the view that this
particular request of the Defence cannot be granted and the First Request for
Redactions must be considered as properly filed.
30.. With respect to the Prosecutor request for a variation of time limit to submit
redactions to 15 documents which were omitted from the Second Request for
redaction, the Single Judge notes the limited length of the documents affected
and the face that the omission was promptly brought to the attention of the
Chamber together with the redactions sought. For the same reasons as above, the
Single Judge considers that the Prosecutor's additional requests for redactions
must be considered as properly presented and are dealt with in the present
decision.
31. With respect to the Prosecutor request for variation of time limit to disclose
incriminating evidence, relating to two items of evidence which do not need any
protective measures, the Single Judge also considers, in light of the
abovementioned and of the nature of the two items of evidence, including their
small volume, that the Prosecutor should also be permitted to rely at the
confirmation of charges hearing on these two items of evidence, provided that
they are disclosed to the Defence as soon as possible but no later than 5 April
2012.

B. Request for Protective Meastir es
(i) Request for authorisation to submit anonymous summaries of statements
of witnesses 47 and 49
32. The Single Judge notes at the outset that Article 61(5) of the Statute provides
that at the confirmation of charges hearing the Prosecutor ''may rely on
documentary or summary evidence''. In this respect, the Appeals Chamber
stated that "the use of summaries by the Prosecutor at the confirmation hearmg
[...] is not subject to any explicit condition" and that "neither the Statute nor the
Rules of Procedure and Evidence foresee that such summaries must be approved
by the Pre-Trial Chamber prior to their presentation at the confirmation
hearing."^^
33. However, the Single Judge notes that although there is no need for the
Prosecutor to seek the authorisation of the Chamber for the purpose of usmg
summaries of statements or transcripts of interviews with witnesses, the
Prosecutor needs the approval of the Chamber to conceal from the Defence the
identities of those witnesses in respect of which he wishes to rety on summaries.
34. Indeed, Rule 76 of the Rules directs the Prosecutor to provide the Defence,
sufficiently in advance to enable its adequate preparation, with the names of the
witnesses on whom he intends to rely at the confirmation of charges hearing. On
the other hand. Article 68(5) of the Statute also allows the Prosecutor, for the
purposes of any proceedings conducted prior to the commencement of the trial,
to withhold such evidence or information which may lead to the grave
endangerment of the security of a witness or his or her family and instead to

of Pre-Trial Chamber I entitled Tirst Decision on the Prosecution Requests and Amended
Requests for Redactions under Rule 81'", 14 December 2006, ICC-01/04-01/06-773, para. 43.

submit a summary thereof. However, such measure shall be exercised in a
manner that is not prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused'
and a fair and impartial trial.
35. In this respect, the Appeals Chamber held that "the presentation of
summaries at the confirmation hearing without disclosure of the identities of the
relevant witnesses to the defence [...] is not per se prejudicial to or inconsistent
with the rights of the accused and a fair and impartial trial."^^
36. In his Application, the Prosecutor requests authorisation to disclose
summaries in lieu of the statements of witnesses 47 and.49 while concealing their
identity to the Defence. In light of the above, the Single Judge will assess
whether disclosing the identities of witnesses 47 and 49 would lead to the grave
endangerrnent of their safety and, if so, whether presenting a summary of their
statements at the confirmation of charges hearing without disclosing their
identities would be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the suspect
and a fair and impartial trial. In this respect, the Single Judge underlines that the
risk caused to these witnesses by the disclosure of their identities to the Defence
must be assessed with regard to each individual witness taking into account his
or her specific situation. In the present decision the Single Judge, in reaching her
decision, has given particular weight to: (i) the witness' particular circumstances;
(ii) the relevant security situation where the witness and his.or her family
currently reside; and (iii) whether the witness benefits from any protective
measures other than the requested anonymity.

a) Witness 49
37. With respect to witness 49, the Prosecutor provided information at the ex
parte hearing held on 20 March 2012 that the witness is [REDACTED]. ^4
Additionally, the Prosecutor stated that [REDACTED] ''would not provide him
much more protection.''^^ In particular, the Prosecutor submits that there exists a
real threat towards him and his family [REDACTED].''^
38. The Prosecutor ftu'ther states that [REDACTED].^^
39. Accordingly, the Prosecutor [REDACTED].^»
40. In the submission of the Prosecutor, granting anonymity to witness 49 is
warranted by the fact that the implementation of the above protective measures
also depends on [REDACTED].^^ However, in light of these facts and efforts, the
Prosecutor does not foresee that appropriate measures can be realistically
implemented by 16 May 2012.^0
41. The Single Judge considers that, on the basis of the available information
submitted by the Prosecutor, the personal circumstances of witness 49 and the
relevant security situation warrant granting the request for anonymity. The
Single Judge is of the view that at this stage of the proceedings, there are no less
intrusive alternative measures short of anonymity and the use of the summary of
his statement to address the risk to the his safety and well being.

42. In addition, as already indicated, the Prosecutor has informed the Chamber
that the summary is "'merely'' intended to "corroborate other evidence" that
would be disclosed to the Defence.^^
43. Therefore, the Single Judge is of the view that such measures are not
prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the suspect. The Prosecutor is
directed to include in this summary, to the extent it does not reveal his identity,
the information relevant to the Case at hand and the potentially exculpatory or
exonerating information that may be contained in these statements
44. In light of the above, the Single Judge will not engage in an assessment of
each request for redaction made by the Prosecutor with respect to the statement
of witness 49 as they were rendered moot by the Prosecutor's request for
anonymity and desire to rely in lieu of his statement on a summary thereof.
b) Witness 4:7
45. In relation to witness 47, the Single Judge notes that according to the
Prosecutor "all objective security concerns with respect to W-0047 have been
managed"^^ and notwithstanding this, witness 47 does not currently consent to
the disclosure of his identity to the Defence.^^ The Prosecutor further informs the
Chamber that he is making all efforts to address the subjective perception of the
witness as regards risks^'^but that he is not confident that they will manage this
before the timeframe for disclosure for the confirmation of charges hearing.^^

46. In the present case, the request for anon)anity does not stem from an
objectively justifiable risk to his safety but rather from the witness refusing his
identity to be revealed to the Defence based on an inaccurate subjective
perception of risk. The Single Judge therefore rejects the Prosecutor's request for
anonymity in respect of witness 47. However, in light of the circumstances, the
Single Judge considers appropriate to vary the time limit to disclose the
statement of witness 47 in order to allow the Prosecutor, in consultation with the
VWU, to address the witness' concerns. Should the Prosecutor decide to rely on
the/Statement of witness 47, any request for redactions may be re-submitted to
the Chamber no later than 19 April 2012.
(ii) Request for delayed disclosure
47. The Single Judge turns now to the Prosecutor's request for authorisation of
a delay in the disclosure of the statements of witnesses 54 and 108, advanced in
the Request for Protective Measures. While requesting redactions to the
statements of the two witnesses,^^ the Prosecutor requests a variation of the 5-day
time limit for disclosure of evidence subject to the Chamber's decision on
redaction proposals.^^
48. With respect to witness 54, the Prosecutor provided information at the ex
parte hearing that [REDACTED].^s [REDACTED].^9 [REDACTED].^o
49. In the submission of the Prosecutor, a delay in the disclosure of statement of
witness 54 is warranted by the fact that the implementation of protective
measures depends on [REDACTED].^^ [REDACTED].^^

50. With respect to witness 108, the Prosecutor submitted that [REDACTED].^^
Prior to the disclosure of the witness' identity to the Defence, the Prosecutor aims
at putting in place additional protective measures, [REDACTED]. ^^

51. The VWU in turn stated at the ex parte hearmg that the Unit has had
extensive consultations with the Office of the Prosecutor regarding both
witnesses in question and that it considers the proposed course of action
appropriate.^^
52. The Single Judge considers that, on the basis of the available information
submitted by the Prosecutor and the VWU, the security of witnesses 54 and 108
cannot properly be guaranteed if their identities were to be disclosed to the
Defence at this moment. ^^ At the same time, the Single Judge accepts that
adequate protective measures permitting the disclosure of the identity: (i) are not
currently missing due to reasons attributable to the Prosecutor; and (ii) will be in
place shortly, at the latest by the first half of Ivlay 2012. In these circumstances,
the Single Judge considers that a deviation from the 5-day time limit established
in the Disclosure Decision is exceptionally warranted. The Single Judge has, in
addition to the security related needs of the witnesses, considered the interests of
the Defence, and is of the view that it is appropriate, in light of the particular
circumstances, to instruct the Prosecutor to disclose, as an interim measure,
anonymous summaries of statements of witnesses 54 and 108.

53. Finally, the Single Judge recalls that, pursuant to Rule 121(3) of the Rules,
the Prosecutor may not rely at the confirmation of charges hearing on any
evidence which has not been properly disclosed to the Defence and included in
the list of evidence provided to the Chamber and the Defence at least 30 days
before the hearing, in this case no later than 16 JVIay 2012.
C. Requests f or redactions
54. As a preliminary matter, the Single Judge will address the objection of the
Defence that it has not been properly informed of the First and Second Requests
for Redactions. The Single Judge recalls that the Decision on Disclosure did not
impose on the Prosecutor the duty to inform the Defence in advance of his
intention to submit requests for redactions. ^^ The Single Judge imposed on the
Prosecutor the obligation to inform the Defence of the existence of such requests
together with the underlying legal and factual basis of his requests for redactions
to the largest extent possible, in line with the jurisprudence of the Appeals
Chamber on this matter.^^
55. Turning now to the analysis of the Prosecutor Requests for Redactions, the
Single Judge recalls that the overriding principle is that of full disclosure, the
authorisation of non-disclosure of information being therefore an exception.^^
6s The Defence indeed misinterpreted the Decision in stating that '7e Jiige unique a ordonné au
Procureur d'informer au préalablement la défense de Vexistence. d'une ou plusieurs demandes
d'expurgations qu'il compterait déposer" (ICC-02/11-01/11-58, p. 4, emphasis added).

The Single Judge further recalls the relevant judgments of the Appeals Chamber,
v\diich provide guidance in addressing the present requests for redactions.^^
56. In light of the Defence Observations, the Single Judge emphasises, for the
sake of clarity, that for any redaction to be authorised pursuant to Rule 81(2) and
(4) of the Rules, she must first and foremost, reach the conclusion that the
disclosure to the Defence of the information sought to be redacted, at this stage
of the proceedings, could: (i) prejudice further or ongoing investigations by the
Prosecutor (Rule 81(2) of the Rules); (ii) affect the confidential character of the
information under Articles 54, 72 and 93 of the Statute (Rule 81(4) of the Rules);
or (iii) pose a danger to a particular person (Rule 81(4) of the Rules). As specified
by the Appeals Chamber, ''the alleged danger must involve an objectively
justifiable risk'' to either the safety of the person concerned or to the Prosecutor's
further or ongoing investigations.^^ The Appeals Chamber further held that the
"circumstances of the individual suspect should be considered, including, inter
alia, whether there are factors indicating that he or she may pass on the
information to others or otherwise put an individual at risk by his or her
actions. "^^
57. After having ascertained the existence of such risk, the Single Judge will
assess whether the requested redactions are necessary namely that the redactions
sought could overcome or reduce such risk and that at this stage there are no less
intrusive alternative protective measures available.

58. The Single Judge will also determine whether the redactions are not
prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the suspect, including the right to
a fair and impartial trial. In so doing, particular attention will be given to the
relevance of the information sought to be redacted to the Defence as well as the
stage of the proceedings, and will ensure at all times that the non-disclosure of
such information "would not result in the confirmation of the charges, viewed as
a whole, to be unfair to the suspect."^^
59. The Single Judge will only grant the requested redactions if she is satisfied
that the abovementioned conditions are met. The Single Judge also underlines
that information that has been withheld may need to be subsequently disclosed,
should circumstances change. The Prosecutor should therefore bring to the
attention of the Chamber any factors that may warrant a variation of a ruling on
iion-disclosure.
60. The Single Judge notes that in his First and Second Requests for Redactions,
the Prosecutor has requested redactions with respect to the following five
categories:
(a) identifying information of family members of witnesses pursuant
to Rule 81 (4) of the Rules;
(b) identifying information of other persons at risk on account of the
activities of the Court, pursuant to Rule 81(4) of the Rules;
(c) identity of persons working in or for the Office of the Prosecutor,
pursuant to Rule 81(2) of the Rules;
(d) information related to the date and location of interviews with the
witness, pursuant to Rule 81(2) of the Rules; and

(e) identifying information of Prosecxitor's sources or leads, pursuant
to Rule 81(2) of the Rules.
61. The Single Judge will set forth in the present decision the approach taken in
the assessment of each requested redaction and will make it available to the
Defence to the extent that they can be revealed to it without endangering the
interests concerned and defeating the very purpose of redactions process.
Accordmgly, the overall reasons for granting or rejecting the requests for
redactions within each category will be provided in the present decision. In the
Annex, which is ex parte, and only available to the Prosecutor and the VWU, the
Single Judge, in compliance with the procedure prescribed by the Appeals
Chamber, will specify to which of the five abovementioned categories each of the
requested redactions belongs and whether the redaction is granted or rejected.
Furthermore, when the specific nature of the requested redaction so requires, the
Single Judge will further provide an additional explanation in the Annex of her
decision.
62. In light of the Prosecutor's Requests for Redactions and the Single Judge's
determination as to the other protective measures he requested (see paragraphs
32-53 above), the Single Judge clarifies that the witnesses' statements or
transcript of interviews and documents related thereto (altogether referred to as
"statement") addressed in the present decision are the following:
(1) the statement of witness 9 (ICC-02/ll-01/ll-38-Conf-Exp-Anxl);

(6) the statement of witness 46 (ICC-02/11-01/1 l-38-Conf-Exp-Anx6

and
(11) the statement of witness 108 (ICC-02/ll-01/ll-53-Conf-Exp-Anx5-
Corr).
63. In addition, the present decision also addresses the request for redactions to
the following documents:
(1) affidavits (ICC-02/ll-01/ll-38-Conf-Exp-Anxll)
(2) ópen source documents (ICC-02/11-01/1 l-53-Conf-Exp-Anx6)
(3) documents emanating from the United Nations (ICC-02/11-00/11-
53-Conf-Exp-Anx7); and
(4) documents emanating from Ivorian authorities (ICC-02/11-01/11-
53-Conf-Exp-Anx8).,
64. The Single Judge notes that in relation to the statement of witness 45 the
Prose(:utor submitted requests for redaction to both the English version (origmal)
and the French translation of his statement. In that respect, the Smgle Judge
underscores that, after obtaining the Chamber's authorisation to redact
information on the text in one of the working languages of the Court, it is the
duty of the Prosecutor, within the same timeframe set forth in the present
decision, to accurately implement the same authorised redactions in the original
No. ICC-02/11-01/11 22/38 27 March 2012
ICC-02/11-01/11-74-Red 27-03-2012 22/38 FB PT
and the translated versions of the piece of evidence to be disclosed to the Defence.
Accordingly, the Single Judge will address the requests for redaction only in one
of the versions of the piece of evidence submitted to her.
65. Before turning to the analysis, the Single Judge finally underlines that in her
assessment of the First and Second Requests for Redactions she took into
consideration information contained in the updated STRA which was prepared
by the Prosecutor and the VWU. In particular, she notes that according to the
overall findings of the updated STRA, there is a risk for witnesses
[REDACTED]75
66. In light of the abovementioned, the Single Judge will now turn to the
Prosecutor's requested redactions and will address the Defence contentions
where applicable.
(i) Requests for redactions pursuant to Rule 81(4) of the Rvles
a) Identifying information of family members of witnesses 45, 54 and 87
67. The Prosecutor requests the authorisation pursuant to Rule 81(4) of the
Rules to redact from the statements of witnesses 45, 54 and 87, the names and
any identifying information of family members. The information sought to be
redacted also includes the whereabouts of these family members or the
whereabouts and phone numbers of the witnesses, disclosure of which could
also endanger their family members' safety.
68. In light of the security situation and context referred to in paragraph 65, the
Single Judge considers that disclosing the names and identifying information,
including the whereabouts, of family members of witnesses 45, 54 and 87 poses
73ICC-02/ll-01/ll-HNE-l-Conf-Exp.
No. ÏCC-02/11-01/11 23/38 27 March 2012
ICC-02/11-01/11-74-Red 27-03-2012 23/38 FB PT
an objectively justifiable risk to their safety and/or physical and psychological
well-being.
69. Moreover, the Single Judge considers that the requested redactions, which
are strictly limited to the place of residence and to the names of the witnesses'
family members, are adequate to minimise this risk and that, at this stage, there
is no less intrusive alternative measure that can be taken to achieve the same goal.
70. Furthermore, in the view of the Single Judge, the redaction of this
information would not result in the hearing to confirm the charges, viewed as a
whole, to be unfair to the suspect insofar as (i) the Defence will have access to the
identities of witnesses 45, 54 and 87; (ii) the family members of witnesses 45, 54
and 87 referred to in this subsection, are not involved in the Court's activities and
(iii) the Defence will have access to the substantial information contained in the
statements of witnesses 45, 54 and 87 and will have accordingly the possibility to
challenge them. In addition, should the Defence wish to contact any of these
witnesses, it will still be in a position to do so following the procedure set out in
the "Decision on the Protocols concerning the disclosure of the identity of
witnesses of the other party and the handling of confidential information in the
course of investigations"^ issued on 6 March 10117^
71. For these reasons, in light of a case-by-case assessment of the requested
redactions which took into consideration the interests at stake and the relevance
of the information sought to be redacted, the Single Judge authorises, pursuant to
Rule 81(4) of the Rules, redactions of the names and identifying information,
including the whereabouts, of family members of witnesses 45, 54 and 87, as set
'^^ ICC-02/11-01/11-49.

ICC-02/11-01/11-74-Red 27-03-2012 24/38 FB PT
out in the Annex to the present decision. Redactions falling within this category
will be marked as A.l.
b) Information related to family members ofivitness 48
72. Furthermore, the Single Judge notes that the Prosecutor requests
authorisation to redact from the statement of witness 48 a piece of information
that could endanger the safety of a member of the witness' family.
73. In light of the security situation and context referred to in paragraph 65, the
Single Judge considers that disclosing the information, as specified in the Annex
to this decision, poses an objectively justifiable risk to the safety and/or physical
and psychological v/ell-bemg of a member of witness 48's family.
74. Moreover, the Single Judge considers that the requested redactions are
strictly limited to a specific and limited piece of information, are adequate to
minimise this risk and that, at this stage, there is no less intrusive alternative
measure that can be taken to achieve the same goal.
75. Furthermore, in the view of the Single Judge, the redaction of this
information would not result in the hearing to confirm the charges, viewed as a
whole, to be unfair to the suspect insofar as: (i) the Defence will have access to
the identity of witnesses 48 who gave the statement; (ii) the family member of
witnesses 48 is not a witness; and (iii) the information sought to be redacted is
not providing any further information on the crimes with which Mr Gbagbo is
charged other than the one already contained in the statement.
76. For these reasons, having balanced the interests at stake and the relevance
of the information sought to be redacted, the Single Judge authorises, pursuant to
Rule 81(4) of the Rules, redactions of information that could endanger the safety
No. ICC-02/11-01/11 25/38 27 March 2012
ICC-02/11-01/11-74-Red 27-03-2012 25/38 FB PT
a member of witness 48's famil}/^, as set out in the Annex to the present decision.
Redactions falling within tjiis category will be marked as A.l.
c) Identifying information of persons at risk on the account of the Court activities
77. The Prosecutor requests authorisation to redact in the statements of
witnesses 10, 44, 45, 48, 54 and 108 and in the affidavits, identifying information
of third parties at risk on account of the activities of the Court.
78. The Single Judge recalls that Rule 81(4) of the Rules - which provides a legal
basis to seek redactions to "protect the safet}^ of witness and victims and
members of their family" - has also been interpreted by the Appeals Chamber as
including the possibility to seek redaction to also protect "[other] persons at risk
on account of the activities of the Court." ^^ Accordiiigty, non disclosure of
information related to third persons at risk on account of the activities of the
Court is also subjected to the demonstration that the disclosure of the
information would expose them to an objectively justifiable risk and. that
redaction is a necessary and proportionate measure to reduce or overcome this
risk.
79. For the sake of clarity, the Single Judge highlights that redactions are not
authorised, on the mere reason that the names or identifying information of third
persons are mentioned in the witness statements. Rather, the Single Judge takes
into consideration, for the purposes of her assessment, the context in which such
names or information appear and the justification provided by the Prosecutor.
Such assessment will accordingly be done on a case-by-case basis. In light of
these elements, redactions may be warranted if this third person may be wrongly
perceived to be a Prosecutor witness, lead or to collaborate with the Court. The
77 Judgment of 13 May 2008, ICC-01/04-01/07-475, para. 56.
No. ICC-02/11-01/11 26/38 27 March 2012
ICC-02/11-01/11-74-Red 27-03-2012 26/38 FB PT
Single Judge will accordingly assess whether: (i) disclosure of the information
sought to be redacted may expose these persons to an objectively identifiable risk;
(ii) the redactions are limited to what is necessary to ensure their safety and are
the adequate measure to minimise the risk to their safety; and (iii) there is no less
restrictive alternative measure that can be taken to achieve the goal of protection.
80. The Single Judge also balanced the rights of the Suspect, in particular the
prejudice that might be cause by the non-disclosure of the information, with the
duty to protect these third persons. In order to assess whether the non disclosure
of the information sought to be redacted would not result in the hearing to
confirm the charge, viewed as a whole, to be unfair to the Defence, particular
attention was given to the limited scope of the confirmation of charges hearing,
whether the redactions sought were strictly limited to the names and identifying
information of such individuals and whether the Defence would still have access
to the substantial information contained in the witness statements.
81. For these reasons, the Single Judge partly grants, pursuant to Rule 81(4) of
the Rules, authorisation to redact from the statements of witnesses 10, 48, 44, 45,
54 and 108 as well as in the affidavits, information related to identifying
information of persons at risk on account of the activities of the Court as detailed
in the Annex to this decision. Redactions falling within this category will be
marked as A.2.
(ii) Requests for redactions pursuant to Rule 81(2) of the Rules
82. The Single Judge recalls that, according to the First Appeals Chamber
Judgment, those fmdings made in relation to redactions sought pursuant to Rule
81(4) of the Rules ''apply mutatis mutandis to redactions sought pursuant to Rule
No. ICC-02/11-01/11 27/38 27 March 2012
ICC-02/11-01/11-74-Red 27-03-2012 27/38 FB PT
81(2) of the Rules".^^ Accordingly, the Prosecutor will need to estabhsh that (i)
the potential prejudice to his investigations is objectively justifiable; (ii) such
prejudice would result from disclosure to the Defence; (iii) the non disclosure of
the information is a necessary and proportionate measure to reduce or overcome
this risk and (iv) the redactions are not prejudicial to or inconsistent with the
rights of the suspect.
83. The Single Judge notes that the Prosecutor requests m particular to redact
pursuant to Rule 81(2) of the Rules identifying information of Prosecutor's staff,
places and dates of interview as well as identifying information of Prosecutor's
sources or leads.
a) Identity of persons working in or for the Office of the Prosecutor
84. The Prosecutor requests authorisation to redact the names, initials,
identifying information and signatures of persons working in or for the Office of
the Prosecutor from the statements of witnesses 9, 10, 11, 44, 45, 46, 48, 54, 69, 87,
108, including in the metadata, and in affidavits, documents emanating from
Ivorian national authorities and open sources documents.
85. . The Single Judge notes that the requested redactions relate more specifically
to staff members who were present, shortly or throughout, the interview with the
witness. The request covers in particular the following categories of persons
working in or for the Office of the Prosecutor: investigators; translators;
interpreters; analysts; psychosocial experts as well as other members of the Office
of the Prosecutor.

ICC-02/11-01/11-74-Red 27-03-2012 28/38 FB PT
86. The Single Judge recalls that as exemplified by the Appeals Chamber, she
"would have to assess, on the basis of [her] knowledge of the factual situation as
a whole, whether the danger sought to be protected could be overcome by
redactions or arises simply from the fact that personnel of the OTP and of the
VWU generally may be easily identifiable in the field."^^ Accordingl}^, depending
on the circumstances, disclosing the names or identifying information of some
members of the Office of the Prosecutor would not pose a justifiable risk to the
further or ongoing investigations of the Prosecutor when, for instance, their
identity and profession within the Office of the Prosecutor is public since they
may have for instance attended public hearings or been interviewed by
journalists.
87. The Single Judge considers that, at this stage of the proceedings, with
investigations still ongoing and in light of the general security situation in Côte
d'lvoire,^^ it is reasonable to believe that, regardless of the logistical reasons also
brought forward by the Prosecutor, the presence of staff members of the Office of
the Prosecutor involved in the field, if their identities are disclosed to the Defence,
could become easily traced and, therefore, bring risk to the ongoing
investigations of the Prosecutor. The Single Judge also believes that, at this stage
of the proceedings, the non disclosure of the names of investigators, translators,
interpreters, analysts, psychosocial experts and of other members of the
Prosecution involved in arranging and participating in the interviews with
witnesses, is the least intrusive protective measure available.
79 Judgment of 13 May 2008, ICC-01/04-01/07-475, para. 98.
so See above paragraph 65.
No. ICC-02/11-01/11 ^ 29/38 27 March 2012
ICC-02/11-01/11-74-Red 27-03-2012 29/38 FB PT
88. The Single Judge takes note of the Defence contention according to which
the identification of staff members present during the interviews is a key
guarantee of procedural propriety in the taking of the statements.
89. The Single Judge is nonetheless of the view that the requested redactions do
not collide with the rights of the suspect to a fair trial.^ Firstly, these redactions
are strictly limited to their names or identifying information and do not
encompass redaction to their specific professions. The Single Judge further
believes that despite the redactions of some names of the Prosecutor's staff, the
Defence will still be able to identify possible faults in the evidence itself and
brmg them to the attention of the Chamber. The Single Judge thus considers that
the redaction of identifymg mformation of Prosecutor's investigators does not
impair the ability of the Defence to identify wrong techniques of investigations
or investigator's omissions to explore relevant leads, as the Defence suggested.
The same holds true in relation to other persons working in or for the Office of
the Prosecutor. The Single Judge however considers that in order to enable the
Defence to identify more efficient^ possible faults, the Prosecutor should
provide the Defence, in the format considered appropriate, with information as
to which statements have been taken by the same investigator or in the presence
of the same interpreter, translator or of another Prosecutor's staff.
90. As a result, the Single Judge considers that the Defence's concern about its
ability to challenge evidence is not of such a nature as to affect the fairness of the
proceedings at this stage.
91. For these reasons, the Single Judge grants authorisation, pursuant to! Rule
81(2) of the Rules, for the redactions of the names, initials, identifying
information and signatures of the investigators, analysts, psychosocial experts

ICC-02/11-01/11-74-Red 27-03-2012 30/38 FB PT
and other members of the Office of the Prosecutor who assisted in the
preparation or process of taking the witness statements. As detailed in the Annex
to this decision, redactions falling withm this category will be marked in the as
fallmg withm category B.l.
92. Finally, the Single Judge observes that the Prosecutor also requested
redaction to the metadata accompanying the evidence. Accordingly, in case the
Single Judge authorises redactions falling under category B.l, the authorisation
also extends to the corresponding information in the metadata Imked to the
evidence concerned.
b) Information related to the dates and places of interviews
93. The Single Judge notes that the Prosecutor requests the redaction of the
specific places of interview with witnesses in the statements of witnesses 9,10,11
and 46.
94. In that respect, the Single Judge considers that a distinction can be made
between general reference to a location - such as a city with a considerable size -
and specific description of a location within a city or a city of a smaller size. The
Single Judge indeed considers that disclosing specific information of the
locations used by the Prosecutor for conducting his interviews with the witnesses,
in particular, where a specific address or description of such locations is
provided, may unduly attract attention to the movements of the Prosecutor's
staff as well as of the witnesses to be interviewed at that location and poses, in
light of the situation referred to at paragraph 65 of the decision, an objectively
justifiable risk to the Prosecutor's further or ongoing investigations.
No. ICC-02/11-01/11 31/38 27 March 207 2
ICC-02/11-01/11-74-Red 27-03-2012 31/38 FB PT
95. The Single Judge also notes that the Prosecutor requests authorisation to
redact the dates, surrounding dates of interviews with witnesses 9, 10,11, 44, 45,
46, 48, 54, 69, 87, 108, and of preliminary meetings with them. The Single Judge
considers that likewise disclosing the specific dates at which the interviews with
these witnesses took place may contribute in attracting attention to the
movements of the Prosecutor's staff as well as of the witnesses who have been
interviewed. In light of the situation referred to at paragraph 65 of the decision,
disclosmg such information poses an objectively justifiable risk to the
Prosecutor's further or ongoing investigations. The Smgle Judge nonetheless
notes that the Prosecutor, at times, requests authorisation to redact the day,
month and year of the interview. In this respect, the Smgle Judge is of the view
that disclosmg the year would not pose an objectively identifiable risk to the
Prosecutor's further or ongoing investigations as it is broad enough to unable
tracing the movement of Prosecutor's staff and witnesses.
96. In light of the above, the Single Judge considers that the disclosure of the
specific locations of interviews as well as the specific dates (day and month) or
surroundmg dates when the interview took place would pose an objectively
justifiable risk to further or ongoing investigations of the Prosecutor. Moreover,
the Single Judge considers that the requested redactions are adequate to
minimise this risk and are limited to what is strictly necessary to overcome such
risk. Additionally, the Single Judge is of the view that, at this stage of the
proceedings, there is no less intrusive measure that can be taken to mitigate the
risk to the Prosecutor's further or ongomg investigations. Furthermore, redacting
this information would not result in the hearing to confirm the charges, viewed
as a whole, to be unfair to the suspect insofar as the information concerned is not,
at this stage, relevant to the preparation of the Defence insofar as the Defence

ICC-02/11-01/11-74-Red 27-03-2012 32/38 FB PT
will still have access to the substantial information contained in the statements
and have the possibility to challenge them.
97. For these reasons and following a case-by-case assessment of each
requested redactions, the Single Judge, authorises pursuant to Rule 81(2) of the
Rules, the Prosecutor to redact reference to the specific locations of interview and
to the specific dates (day and month) or surroundmg dates when the mterview
took place. As detailed in the Annex to this decision, redactions falling within
this category will be marked as falling within category B.2.
98. Finally, the Single Judge observes that the Prosecutor also requested
redaction to the metadata accompanying the evidence. Accordingly, in case the
Single Judge authorises redactions falling under category B.2, the authorisation
also extends to the correspondmg information m 'the metadata linked to the
evidence concerned.
c) Identifying information of Prosecutor's sources or leads
99. The Prosecutor requests authorisation to redact pursuant to Rule 81(2) of
the Rules the names and identifying information of Prosecutor's sources or leads
from the statements of witnesses 10, 45, 44 and 54.
100. The terms "Prosecutor's sources" or "Prosecutor's leads" are not referred to
in Rule 81(2) of the Rules. According to the Appeals Chamber, "further or
ongoing investigations may be prejudiced if potential prosecution witnesses are
interfered with in a manner that could lead them being unable to co-operate
further with the Prosecutor."^^ The Appeals Chamber further held that "[a]s such,
if it can be demonstrated by the Prosecutor that the disclosure of the identities

ICC-02/11-01/11-74-Red 27-03-2012 33/38 FB PT
and identifying information of such individuals to the Defence could lead to the
intimidation of or interference with such individuals, further or ongoing
investigations could be prejudiced."^^ Accordingly, the Single Judge considers
that non-disclosure of identities and identifying information of Prosecutor's
sources or leads, as requested by the Prosecutor, can be sought and, if adequately
justified, granted pursuant to Rule 81(2) of the Rules.^^
101. In light of the situation referred to in paragraph .65 of the present decision,
the Single Judge is of the view that disclosure of the names and identifying
information of Prosecutor's sources or leads would, in certain circumstances as
set out in Annex I to the decision, pose an objectively justifiable risk to the
further or ongoing investigations of the Prosecutor. Having assessed on a case by
case basis the requested redactions, the Single Judge is of the view that they are
adequate to minimise the risk identified and are strictly necessary to overcome
any risk of prejudice to the Prosecutor's further or ongoing investigations. In
addition, the Single Judge is of the view that, at this stage of the proceedings,
there is no less intrusive alternative measure that can be caken to achieve the goal
of protecting the further or ongoing mvestigations of the Prosecutor. The Single
Judge considers furthermore that authorising the requested redactions would not
result in the hearing to confirm the charges, viewed as a whole, to be unfair to
the Defence insofar as the Defence will still have access to the substantial
information contained in the witness statements and have the possibility to
challenge them.
102. For these reasons, following a case-by-case analysis of the relevance of the
information to the Defence and balancmg the different interests at stake, the

Single Judge authorises pursuant to Rule 81(2) of the Rules, redactions of the
names and identifying information of Prosecutor's sources or leads, as set out in
the Annex to the present decision. These redactions will be marked m the Annex
as falling within category B.3.
D. Lifting of redactions from the Prosecutofs confidential redacted version of
his application f or a warrant of arrest
103. The Smgle Judge notes that the Prosecutor requests authorisation to lift
certain redactions from the confidential redacted version of his application for a
warrant of arrest against Laurent Gbagbo pursuant to Article 58 of the Statute.^"^
104. Having reviewed the information for which lifting of redactions is sought,
the Single Judge is of the view that at this stage of the proceedings and in light of
the adoption of the Protocol on the handling of confidential information,^^ the
redactions are no longer justified. Accordingly, the Prosecutor is authorised to
lift the redactions referred to at paragraph 10 of his First Request for Redactions
and to file in the record of the case a corresponding new version of the
confidential redacted version of his application for a warrant of arrest against
Laurent Gbagbo pursuant to Article 58 of the Statute.
