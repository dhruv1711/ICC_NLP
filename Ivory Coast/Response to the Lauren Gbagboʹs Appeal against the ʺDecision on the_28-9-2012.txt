INTRODUCTION
1. Mr. Laurent Gbagbo (“the Appellant”) asks the Appeals Chamber1 to overturn
the “Decision on the ‘Corrigendum of the challenge to the jurisdiction of the
International Criminal Court on the basis of articles 12(3), 19(2), 21(3), 55 and 59
of the Rome Statute filed by the Defence for President Gbagbo’” (ICC‐02/11‐
01/11‐212) (“Decision”), of Pre‐Trial Chamber I (“Chamber”). 2
   
2. The Appellant raises ten purported errors related to the manner in which the
Chamber:  
(i) granted the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire (“CIV”) the right to make
observations in response to the Appellant’s original challenge to
jurisdiction (issues 1 and 2);  
(ii) approached the CIV’s declaration of 18 April 2003, and letters of 2010
and 2011 (issues 3 to 5);  
(iii) interpreted article 55(1) of the Rome Statute (issue 6);  
(iv) approached issues concerning compliance under article 59 (issues 7
and 8);
(v) qualified part of the Appellant’s original challenge to jurisdiction as a
motion based on abuse of process (issue 9); and  
(vi) determined the necessary conditions for being able to find an
exception to jurisdiction (issue 10).    
The Appellant also seeks from the Appeals Chamber a declaration that the
International Criminal Court (“Court”) has no jurisdiction in this case on the
basis of the alleged violation of the fundamental rights of Mr. Gbagbo.3
(“Appellant’s Application”).

3. The Prosecution requests that the Appeals Chamber reject the Appellant’s
Application in its entirety as the Appellant has failed to demonstrate any
discernible error in the Decision.
BACKGROUND
4. On 1 October 2003, the CIV lodged a declaration under article 12(3) of the
Statute dated 18 April 2003, accepting the jurisdiction of the Court over crimes
committed on its territory since the events of 19 September 2002 (“Declaration
of 18 April 2003”).  The CIV indicated that the Declaration of 18 April 2003 was
made for an unspecified period of time into the future (“pour une durée
indeterminée”).
5. On 14 December 2010, the President, Prosecutor and Registrar of the Court
received a letter from Mr. Alassane Ouattara (“Mr. Ouattara”), which confirmed
the continuing validity of the Declaration of 18 April 2003 and committed the
CIV to full and immediate cooperation with the Court, in particular with
respect to crimes and abuses committed since March 2004 (“2010 Letter”).  
6. On 3 May 2011, Mr. Ouattara again wrote to the Prosecutor, referring to the
serious crisis that had followed the presidential elections of 31 October 2010 and
28 November 2010 “during which it is unfortunately reasonable to believe that
crimes falling under the jurisdiction of the [Court] have been committed”.  In
light of the gravity of the crimes, he requested the assistance of the Court to
ensure that perpetrators would not go unpunished (“2011 Letter”).
7. On 3 October 2011, Pre‐Trial Chamber III, following a request of the
Prosecutor,4 authorised the commencement of an investigation in the CIV
(“First article 15 Decision”)5 pursuant to article 15 of the Rome Statute
(“Statute”).  It concluded that the Court had “jurisdiction over crimes allegedly
committed in Côte d’Ivoire since 19 September 2002, on the basis of the

No. ICC‐02‐11‐01/11 5/35 28 September 2012
Declaration of acceptance of 18 April and the letters of December 2010 and May
2011.”6
    Pre‐Trial Chamber III further indicated that since the CIV had
confirmed its acceptance of jurisdiction in 2010 and 2011, the Chamber did not
need to assess whether the Declaration of 18 April 2003 could, on its own, cover
crimes allegedly committed in 2010 or 2011.7    The majority of Pre‐Trial
Chamber III considered that the relevant timeframe for the authorized
investigation was “with respect to crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court
committed since 28 November 2010 and with respect to continuing crimes that
may be committed in the future […] insofar as they are part of the context of the
ongoing situation in Côte d’Ivoire”.8
8. On 23 November 2011, Pre‐Trial Chamber III issued a warrant for the arrest of
the Appellant for crimes against humanity allegedly committed on the territory
of the CIV between 16 December 2010 and 12 April 2011.9
9. On 25 November 2011, the Registry transmitted the arrest warrant and request
for surrender of the Appellant to the competent CIV authorities.10
10. On 29 November 2011, the Appellant was notified of the arrest warrant and
appeared before the CIV judicial authorities in the presence of his legal
counsel.11    On the same day he was surrendered to The Netherlands and
detained in the Court’s detention unit.12
11. On 9 December 2011, the Appellant lodged an appeal to the CIV Cour Suprême
challenging the CIV judicial decision of 29 November 2011 to surrender him to
the Court.13  
12. On the basis of additional information provided by the Prosecutor as to
potentially relevant crimes committed between 2002 and 2010, on 22 February

2012 the Chamber expanded its authorisation for an investigation in the CIV to
include crimes within the jurisdiction of the Court allegedly committed
between 19 September 2002 and 28 November 2010 (“The Second article 15
Decision”).14
13. On 15 March 2012, the situation in the CIV was reassigned to Pre‐Trial Chamber
I.15
14. On 29 May 2012, the Appellant filed his challenge to the jurisdiction of the
Court on the basis of articles 12(3), 19(2), 21(3), 55 and 59 of the Statute
(“Challenge to Jurisdiction”).16  The Appellant requested that the Chamber find
that: (i) the Declaration of 18 April 2003 is not relevant to the period covered by
the allegations against the Appellant between 16 December 2010 and 12 April
2011; and (ii) the 2010 Letter and 2011 Letter have no legal value so cannot
broaden the ambit of the Court’s jurisdiction beyond that accepted in the
Declaration of 18 April 2003.    Accordingly, the Appellant requested the
Chamber to find that the Court “lacks jurisdiction for the period and events
referred to in the warrant of arrest issued for [the Appellant]… on 23 November
2011 and in the Document Containing the Charges filed by the Prosecutor on 16
May 2012”.17 In the alternative, the Appellant sought a finding from the
Chamber that the Appellant’s rights under articles 55 and 59 of the Statute were
infringed during his eight‐month detention in the CIV and in the course of his
transfer to the Court on 29 November 2011, and that these violations render a
fair trial impossible.18  Accordingly, the Appellant requested the Chamber “to
entertain the challenge to jurisdiction” and to rule that the “Court cannot
exercise its jurisdiction in such circumstances”.19

15. On 15 June 2012 the Chamber set deadlines for the Prosecutor and Office of
Public Council for Victims (“OPCV”) to respond to the Appellant’s Challenge to
Jurisdiction.20
16. On 18 June 2012, the CIV requested leave to submit observations on the
Appellant Challenge to Jurisdiction, under regulation 24(3) of the Regulations
of the Court (“Regulations”) (“CIV’s Request to Respond”).  On the same day,
the CIV submitted its observations on the Appellant Challenge to Jurisdiction,21
requesting the Chamber, inter alia, to rule that: (i) the Declaration of 18 April
2003, as confirmed by the 2010 Letter and 2011 Letter, confers jurisdiction on the
Court to adjudicate crimes committed in the context of the situation  that has
existed in the CIV since 19 September 2002;22 (ii) the alleged violations of the
Appellant’s rights that purportedly took place during his detention and
subsequent transfer to the Court should not be considered issues of
jurisdiction;23 and (iii) the violations alleged by the Appellant are factually
unfounded.24
17. On 25 June 2012, the Appellant objected to the CIV’s Request to Respond, and
requested that the observations filed by the CIV be disregarded (“Appellant’s
Objection to CIV Observations”).25
18. The OPCV submitted its observations on the Appellant’s Challenge to
Jurisdiction on 27 June 2012, requesting the Chamber to reject the requests
advanced by the Appellant.26  
19. On 28 June 2012 the Prosecutor submitted her observations on the Appellant’s
Challenge to Jurisdiction, requesting the Chamber to reject it in its entirety.27

submitted by the Prosecutor and the OPCV (“Appellant’s Request to Reply”).28
21. The Prosecutor filed her response objecting to the Appellant’s Request to Reply
on 10 July 2012.29
22. On 15 August 2012, the Chamber issued its Decision, rejecting the Appellant’s
Request to Reply and Appellant’s Challenge to Jurisdiction, and granting the
CIV’s Request to Respond.30
SUBMISSIONS
Standard of Review
23. The Appellant is alleging that the Pre‐Trial Chamber made nine errors of law
and one error of fact.    
24. In relation to questions of law, the Appeals Chamber has held that it “will not
defer to the Trial Chamberʹs interpretation of the law. Rather, it will arrive at its
own conclusions as to the appropriate law and determine whether or not the
Trial Chamber misinterpreted the law. If the Trial Chamber committed such an
error, the Appeals Chamber will only intervene if the error materially affected
the Impugned Decision.”31
25. In relation to errors of fact, the Appeals Chamber “will not interfere with a Pre‐
Trial or Trial Chamberʹs evaluation of the evidence just because the Appeals
Chamber might have come to a different conclusion. It will interfere only in the
case of a clear error, namely where it cannot discern how the Chamberʹs
conclusion could have reasonably been reached from the evidence before it. In
the absence of any clear error on the part of the Pre‐Trial Chamber, the Appeals

Chamber defers to the Pre‐Trial Chamber”.32 The burden on the Appellant is to
show that the Pre‐Trial Chamber misappreciated facts, disregarded relevant
facts or took into account facts extraneous to the sub judice issues.33
26. The Prosecution requests that the Appellant’s Application be rejected in its
entirety as it submits that the Appellant has not demonstrated any discernible
error of law or fact.    
The Prosecution’s Response to the First Ground of Appeal   
Whether the Chamber erred in law by granting the CIV’s Request to Respond34
27. The Appellant argues that the Chamber erred in law by allowing the CIV to
make observations, when there was no legal basis for doing so, arguing that:  
(i) Regulation 24(3) of the Regulations only grants that right to states
participating in the proceedings and rule 59 of the rules similarly
limits communication of jurisdiction and admissibility challenges,
and the right to make representations, to those states that refer a
situation under article 13. The Appellant contends that it was wrong
for the Chamber to rely upon these provisions as the CIV did not
refer the situation pursuant to article 13 (it was a case initiated propio
motu by the Prosecutor) and is not a party to the proceedings;35  and  
(ii) The Chamber cannot rely upon rule 58(2) of the rules as a basis for
allowing the CIV’s Request to Respond, as rule 59 prevents the
Chamber from treating the CIV as a party to the proceedings.36
28. The Chamber did not err in law when granting the CIV’s Request to Respond.
The Appellant misconstrues the Decision, as the Chamber did not authorise the

CIV to make observations on the basis of Regulation 24(3) of the Regulations37
or rule 59 of the rules,38 and certainly did not treat the CIV as a party or
participant to the proceedings. 39    Rather, the Chamber authorised the CIV’s
Request to Respond pursuant to rule 58(2) of the rules,40 which is a valid basis
for the Chamber to allow States that are not party to the proceedings to make
observations where necessary. Pre‐Trial Chamber III similarly granted a State
that was not party to the proceedings the opportunity to submit observations in
the Prosecutor v Bemba (“Bemba case”), pursuant to rule 58(2).41   
29. Rule 58(2) recognises the inherent discretion and power of Chambers seized
with a challenge to jurisdiction to “decide on the procedure to be followed
[and]…take appropriate measures for the proper conduct of proceedings”.   The
Appellant himself concedes that the Chamber had discretion under rule 58(2),
but asserts that rule 59 effectively trumps rule 58(2), and accordingly the
Chamber had no discretion to authorise CIV to make observations.42 However,
the Appellant overlooks that rule 59 was not breached because the Chamber did
not treat the CIV as a participant to the proceedings. 43 The Appellant is
confusing a duty imposed on the Registrar to inform the referring State (rule
59), with a discretion afforded to Chambers of the Court to decide the best
manner to determine a challenge (rule 58 (2)).

rule 58(2) to establish the procedure to be followed concerning a Appellant application challenging admissibility,
Pre-Trial Chamber III in The Prosecutor v Bemba granted the authorities of the Democratic Republic of Congo
(“DRC”) the opportunity to file their observations in response to the Appellant application. As the state referral in
that case is from the Central African Republic, the DRC is not a ‘party’ to those proceedings.
42 ICC-02/11-01/11-240, para.78.
43 ICC-02/11-01/11-240, para.78. As the Chamber was not treating the CIV as a ‘party’ to the proceedings or
according the CIV any such rights, the jurisprudence of Pre-Trial Chamber II cited by the Appellant (ICC-01.09-
02/11-340, para.11) is also not relevant. In any event, the Prosecution observes that Pre-Trial Chamber II in that
case acknowledged that even if the State of Kenya could not be considered a participant in the instant proceedings
as the admissibility challenge was lodged by the Appellant “this does not mean that a State will never have an
interest when it is not the triggering entity of such a challenge” (ICC-01.09-02/11-340, para.11).

30. In the instant case, the Chamber rightly decided that observations from the CIV
would be of “manifest relevance for the determination of the issue sub judice”,44
bearing in mind the nature of the arguments raised by the Appellant himself,
which include serious allegations that CIV authorities committed acts of torture
and violated national procedures in connection with the Appellant’s surrender
to the Court. 45 There is no error in this conclusion.   
The Prosecution’s Response to the Second Ground of Appeal  
Whether the Chamber erred in law by not first deciding on the CIV’s Request to
Respond in a separate decision
31. The Appellant asserts that the Chamber erred in law by not addressing the CIV
Request to Respond in a separate decision, as this deprived him of the right to
respond or to appeal under article 82(1)(d) of the Statute.46   He contends that
the ability to appeal the jurisdiction Decision provides only a partial remedy,
because even if the Appeals Chamber allows the appeal on this ground the Pre‐
Trial Chamber will no longer be able to “forget” the CIV’s observations.47   
32. Contrary to the Appellant’s assertions, the Chamber did not err in law, and the
Appellant did not suffer any material prejudice, by deciding not to deal with
CIV’s Request to Respond in a separate decision and by receiving the CIV’s
substantive observations prior to making its determination on the request, for
the following reasons:
(i) First, the Appellant had an opportunity to object to the CIV’s Request to
Respond before the Chamber’s Decision, and in fact did so, on 25 June
2012. 48

44 ICC-02/11-01/11-212, para.22. See also ICC-02/11-01/11-236 OA2, para.4. The Appeals Chamber in this
instance also deemed it “not only desirable, but rather, essential for the proper determination of this appeal to hear
the observations of the [CIV] on [the Appellant’s] document in support of the appeal”, bearing in mind the
Appellant’s allegations regarding purported actions or conduct he attributed to the CIV.

(ii) Second, the Chamber granted the CIV’s Request to Respond only after
considering the Appellant’s Objection to the CIV’s Request to Respond,
and this fact was articulated in its Decision.49  
(iii) Third, the Appellant was not deprived of the ability to appeal the
admission of the CIV’s submissions,50 which he is doing as part of the
current appeal.51
(iv) Fourth, and contrary to the Appellant’s suggestion, 52 no material
prejudice has been caused by the Chamber’s approach to the CIV’s
submissions.  The Pre‐Trial Chamber is composed of professional judges
who are perfectly capable of disregarding the CIV’s submissions if the
Appeals Chamber considers that they committed an error of law in
receiving the    observations. Similarly, the Chamber was capable of
separately deciding whether in its discretion it should consider the CIV’s
submissions, irrespective of whether it was technically already in receipt
of those observations when it made that determination.53   Moreover, the
Appellant was arguably placed in a better situation, as he was able to
appeal the joint Decision directly without having separately to seek leave
to appeal pursuant to article 82(1)(d).
The Prosecution’s Response to the Third Ground of Appeal
Whether the Chamber erred in law by considering the Declaration of 18 April 2003
in the light of the “concrete situation”
33. The Appellant asserts that the Chamber erred in law in the test it used to
determine the temporal scope of the situation.54  The Chamber relied upon the
plain language of the 12(3) Declaration of 18 April 2003, the evidence contained

in the 2010 Letter and 2011 Letter, the First article 15 Decision and – pursuant to
rule 44 of the rules – the “objective parameters of the situation” to determine
that the Court has jurisdiction over crimes allegedly committed in 2010 and
2011.  While the Appellant’s claims under this ground of appeal lack clarity, the
Appellant seems to argue that the temporal scope of the situation must be
defined according to the 12(3) Declaration of 18 April 2003, that the terms of this
Declaration must be defined narrowly, and that therefore the Court does not
have jurisdiction over crimes occurring after the date of that Declaration.   
34. Contrary to the Appellant’s assertion,55 the Chamber did not err in interpreting
the Declaration of 18 April 2003 and in defining the temporal scope of the
situation to include future crimes.   
Article 12(3) and article 13
35. As an initial matter, the Appellant appears to be arguing that a conferral of
jurisdiction under article 12(3) cannot be interpreted in the same way as a
referral of a situation under article 13, and that as a matter of law a State may
not confer prospective jurisdiction under article 12(3) for future crimes.56  The
Appellant contends that an acceptance of jurisdiction under article 12 (3) does
not create a “situation” before the Court, but only constitutes an acceptance of
the Court’s subject‐matter jurisdiction.
36. If this is the Appellant’s argument, it is not supported by the Statute. Article
12(3) is the mechanism for non‐States Parties to confer jurisdiction on the Court,
while article 13 provides States Parties with the opportunity to refer specific
situations to the Court. Accordingly, a non‐state party that accepts the Court’s
jurisdiction under article 12(3) of the Statute is not required to make a further
”referral” of a situation under article 13 of the Statute.  Nor is any other step

55 ICC-02/11-01/11-240, paras. 86-89.
56 The Appellant concedes that a State may confer future jurisdiction under article 12(3), but only for past crimes.
But this is illogical. A grant of prospective jurisdiction only makes sense if it refers to future crimes. In any event,
there is nothing in article 12(3) and rule 44 of the rules that precludes a State from conferring prospective
jurisdiction for future crimes that are part of the same situation.

necessary for the purposes of creating an active “situation” before the Court.  
The Chamber was clear on this distinction, as the Appellant himself
acknowledges, agreeing with the Appellant that “a declaration made under
article 12(3) of the Statute cannot be equated with a referral”.57    
37. If the Appellant is arguing, however, that a State Party can confer future
jurisdiction with a referral of a situation under article 13, while a non‐State
Party may not do so under article 12(3), that is simply incorrect.    Nothing in
article 12(3) indicates that a State may not use this mechanism to confer
prospective jurisdiction, particularly since article 12(3) is the only device for a
non‐State Party to confer jurisdiction on the Court.  Rather, the temporal scope
of jurisdiction must be defined by the plain terms of the article 12(3)
declaration, the intent of the State making the Declaration, and the objective
parameters of the situation as defined in rule 44 of the rules.   
38. In this sense, the Appellant’s efforts to divorce “declaration” from “situation”
are futile:  rule 44 makes it clear that the inquiry required to define a situation
(including its temporal scope) is the same under article 12(3) and article 13.  It
states that when a State lodges an article 12(3) declaration, the Registrar shall
inform that State that the consequence is “the acceptance of jurisdiction with
respect to the crimes referred to in article 5 of relevance to the situation ….”.58  
The reference to “the situation” in this rule shows that an article 12(3) referral is
the non‐State Party equivalent of an article 13 referral for a State Party, and that
the scope of the situation under each must be interpreted in the same manner.59  
The Appellant seeks to minimize this critical point by claiming, without any
support, that the use of the term “situation” in rule 44 is “incidental”.60

57 ICC-02/11-01/11-240, para.86.
58 Emphasis added
59 As one commentator has noted, the intent of article 12 (3) is “that the Court could exercise jurisdiction with
respect to any crime referred to in article 5 arising out of a ‘situation’ which is referred to it. The adjustment that
results from rule 44 of the rules of Procedure and Evidence seems to confirm this, with its reference to ‘situation’”
(M. Cherif Bassiouni, The Legislative History of the International Criminal Court: Introduction, Analysis and
Integrated Text, Vol. I, 2005, pp. 84-85).

39. Therefore, there is no statutory bar that prevented the CIV from referring
prospective crimes within a situation, as it explicitly did in its 18 April 2003
referral.  
Temporal scope  
40. The Appellant further seeks a restrictive interpretation of the intent of the CIV
when making the Declaration of 18 April 2003, and of the temporal scope of the
ensuing ”situation”, as being limited to the precise events taking place at that
time.61  However, as the Chamber pointed out: “[t]he words of the Declaration of
18 April 2003, whereby [the CIV] recognised the jurisdiction of the Court for ‘une durée
indeterminée’, when given their ordinary meaning, make it clear that [the CIV] accepted
the jurisdiction of the Court over events from 19 September 2002 onwards”.
62
41. As the Chamber observes, the Appellant does not contest Pre‐Trial Chamber
III’s finding 63 that the same situation existed in Côte d’Ivoire between 2002 and
2010. This finding supports the Chamber’s conclusion that the situation
encompasses events subsequent to the Declaration.64    Further support is
provided  by the jurisdictional test set out in The Prosecutor v Mbarushimana, in
which Pre‐Trial Chamber I found that “a situation can include not only crimes that
had already been or were being committed at the time of the referral, but also crimes
committed after that time, in so far as they are sufficiently linked to the situation of
crisis that was ongoing at the time of referral”.65    
42. Moreover, while the Appellant himself concedes that is important to determine
the intent of the state that makes the article 12(3) declaration, he essentially

between 19 September 2002 and 28 November 2010, although reaching varying levels of intensity at
different locations and different times, are to be treated as a single situation, in which an ongoing crisis
involving a prolonged political dispute and power-struggle culminated in the events in relation to which
the Chamber earlier authorised an investigation. 64 ICC-02/11/-01/11-212, para.64.

ignores the observations made by the CIV, which confirm that: (i) the 2010
Letter and 2011 Letter simply reiterate the CIV’s acceptance of jurisdiction made
in 2003, when the CIV accepted the Court’s jurisdiction for an indeterminate
duration;66 and (ii) the CIV intended that the scope of the Declaration of 18
April 2003 encompass crimes committed from 19 September 2002 onward
during the duration of the situation.67
Rule 44
43. Finally, the Chamber did not state, as the Appellant suggests, that when
analysing the scope of a declaration against the objective parameters of the
situation, rule 44 of the rules empowers the Chamber effectively to impose its
own views in an arbitrary fashion with regard to duration and geography.68  
Instead, the Chamber stated that: “while States may indeed seek to define the
scope of its [sic] acceptance, such definition cannot establish arbitrary
parameters to a given situation as it must encompass all crimes that are relevant to
it.”69 (Emphasis added). So ultimately it is for the Court to “determine whether
the scope of [a State’s] acceptance, as set out in its declaration, is consistent with
the objective parameters of the situation at hand”.70  
44. As the Chamber rightly points out, rule 44 of the rules was intended by its
drafters to limit a State’s discretion in framing the ”situation” that may be
investigated in accepting the Court’s jurisdiction. This was done in order to
avoid a State seeking selectively to accept jurisdiction only in relation to certain
crimes or certain parties71 and to ensure that States that choose to stay out of the

70 Ibid. 71 Ibid. The Chamber states: “[i]ndeed, there were concerns that the wording of article 12(3) of the Statute, and
specifically the reference to the acceptance of jurisdiction ‘with respect to the crime in question’, would allow the
Court to be used as a political tool by States not party to the Statute who could selectively accept the exercise of
jurisdiction in respect of certain crimes or certain parties to a conflict”. Citing S.A.Williams, “Article 12,
Preconditions to the Exercise of Jurisdiction”, in: O. Triffterer (ed.), Commentary on the Rome Statute: Observers’

treaty not use the Court “opportunistically”. 72  As noted above, rule 44 requires
the Registrar to remind States that once they accept jurisdiction by making an
article 12(3) declaration, this “has as a consequence the acceptance of
jurisdiction with respect to the crimes referred to in article 5 of relevance to the
situation….” (Emphasis added).73    
45. Accordingly, the Chamber is correct in concluding that “while States may
choose to consent or not to the jurisdiction of the Court through declarations
provided for in article 12(3) of the Statute, the scope of such declarations is pre‐
determined by the ICC legal framework”.74    
46. In any event, as the Chamber correctly observed, in this instance, the CIV did
not in fact seek to define the precise scope of the situation when it accepted the
Court’s jurisdiction: “[…] nothing in the Declaration of 18 April 2003 indicates any
attempt by [the CIV] to restrict the scope by temporal or other limitations to the crimes
to be investigated in [the CIV] after those events”.
75
47. Accordingly, no error was made by the Chamber in relation to its  
interpretation of the Declaration and  its proper scope.

48. The Appellant argues that: (i)    the Declaration of 18 April 2003 should be
treated, legally speaking, as a “unilateral act” of a State;76 (ii) this has as a legal
consequence that the intent of those who made the declaration must be
interpreted restrictively in light of the circumstances at the time and not for
future events (i.e. only in relation to the specific crisis of 19 September 2002 that
ended in January 2003);77 and (iii) the phrase “pour une durée indeterminée” in the
Declaration of 18 April 2003 is a reference to the exercise of the Court’s
jurisdiction, not to that jurisdiction applying to new crimes committed.78
49. Contrary to what the Appellant contends, the Chamber made no error by not
explicitly determining whether or not the Declaration of 18 April 2003
amounted to a “unilateral act” of the CIV.79   
50. First, the Chamber addressed the Appellant’s arguments as to the alleged
consequences of the Declaration of 18 April 2003 amounting to a ”unilateral
act”.80    As described above (at paragraphs 40 and    43 to 47), the Chamber
confirmed that  
(i) the CIV’s Declaration of 18 April 2003 states that the CIV was
recognising the Court’s jurisdiction for “une durée indeterminée”,
making clear that it accepted the Court’s jurisdiction over events from
19 September 2002 onwards and for crimes perpetrated in that time
period (and not just for events at the precise time the declaration was
made).81 Accordingly, contrary to the Appellant assertion, there was
no ambiguity; and
(ii) the Appellant’s proposed restrictive interpretation of the scope of the
situation (even if there were factual support for it which there is not)
should not be adopted, as rule 44 of the rules limits the discretion
afforded to States in defining the ‘situation’ for investigation when

accepting the Court’s jurisdiction, and acknowledges the Court’s
power to determine the scope of any acceptance set out in a
declaration.82  
51. Moreover, contrary to what the Appellant contends, and as outlined by the
OPCV,83 the law relating to unilateral declarations of States does not apply in
this instance, as prima facie ”unilateral” acts carried out by States in the context
of international justice are excluded from the scope of the ”Guiding Principles
applicable to unilateral declarations of States capable of creating legal
obligations of 2006”.84  
52. Second, there is no applicable principle of interpretation whereby declarations
made before this Court should be interpreted narrowly, nor there is any
requirement in the Statute to that effect. The practice of other international
bodies in fact supports the opposite conclusion: international human rights
jurisprudence, for instance, supports adopting a broad, and not restrictive,
interpretation of declarations made under article 12(3) of the Statute.85

The Prosecution’s Response to the Fifth Ground of Appeal
Whether the Chamber erred in law by drawing conclusions on the 2010 Letter and
2011 Letter without deciding on their legal nature
53. The Appellant contends that the Chamber erred in law by drawing conclusions
on the 2010 Letter and 2011 Letter signed by Mr. Ouattara without deciding on
their legal nature (including the issue of Mr. Ouattara’s ability to bind the CIV
when he signed them).86
54. The Chamber was correct that there was no requirement in law for it to assess
the legal validity of the 2010 Letter and 2011 Letter or Mr. Ouattara’s capacity to
bind the CIV on those dates, 87 as:
(i) The Chamber had concluded on the basis of the Declaration of 18
April 2003 that the Court had jurisdiction over all alleged crimes since
19 September 2002, including those allegedly committed since 28
November 2010; 88 and  
(ii) the Chamber made it clear that it was not relying upon the 2010
Letter and 2011 Letter as a basis for asserting the Court’s jurisdiction,
but simply referred to both letters as further evidence, like other
subsequent CIV statements made, of the CIV’s acceptance of the
Court’s jurisdiction. 89
Thus, the issue of the legal validity of the letters was not relevant to the Chamber’s
determination. This means that the error alleged, even if accepted, would be
inconsequential. This ground of appeal should accordingly also be dismissed.

The Prosecution’s Response to the Sixth Ground of Appeal
Whether the Chamber erred in law on the scope of article 55(1) of the Statute
55. The Appellant asserts that the Chamber erred in law when it concluded that: (i)
the rights afforded under article 55 only relate to “investigations” conducted by
or at the behest of the Prosecutor of the Court and not by an entity other than
the Prosecutor which is not related to proceedings before this Court;90 and (ii)
that it is “decisive” that the alleged violations of article 55 were not perpetrated
by the Prosecutor or by the CIV authorities at the behest of the Prosecutor or
any organ of the Court,91 and that therefore the Appellant’s allegations were
purely speculative.92
56. The Appellant argues that article 55 rights extend to not only to investigations
conducted by or at the behest of the Prosecutor of the Court but also those
conducted by the CIV authorities, because: (i) article 55 should be interpreted
broadly, in accordance with the Vienna Convention, in light of the provision’s
aims to protect a suspect’s fundamental rights93 and the Court’s alleged duty to
protect those rights;94 (ii)  a textual reading of the French version of article 55(1)
suggests that a suspect should benefit from article 55 rights from the time  the
Prosecutor decides to initiate an investigation propio motu    (i.e. in this case,
while the Appellant was in the CIV’s custody);95    and (iii) the Chamber’s test
requiring proof that measures were taken on behalf of or at the behest of the
Prosecutor is insurmountable for Mr. Gbagbo as he was not granted access to all
communications between the Prosecution and the CIV.96

57. The Chamber correctly interpreted the plain language of article 55(1) of the
Statute when it found that: (i) the scope of the rights afforded by this provision
only relate to “an investigation under this Statute”, namely investigations as
conducted by or at the behest of the Prosecutor of the Court;97 and conversely
that (ii) any investigation conducted by an entity other than the Prosecution,
which is not related to the proceedings before the Court, does not trigger any
rights under article 55.98   
58. This interpretation is supported by the plain text and structure of the Statute, as
article 55 follows other provisions in Chapter V    that only deal with
“investigations” as conducted by the Prosecutor of the Court, namely the power
of the Prosecutor to initiate an investigation (article 53) and the Prosecutor’s
powers and duties with respect to such investigations (article 54).  The drafters
also intended that article 55 relate to the investigation phase conducted by the
Prosecution.99
59. The Appeals Chamber’s jurisprudence also supports the view that the reference
to “investigation under this Statute” in article 55 must relate to investigations
conducted by (or at the behest of) the Prosecutor of the Court:  
(i) First, when interpreting the correlating rules of procedure and
evidence in relation to Chapter 5 (investigation and prosecution), the
Appeals Chamber observed that this: “pertains to how the Prosecutor
should go about collecting evidence during an investigation…”100
(ii) Second, the Appeals Chamber has confirmed that “[m]anifestly,
authority for the conduct of investigations vests in the Prosecutor”101
and that “an investigation is not a judicial proceeding but an inquiry

“responsible for the investigation and the prosecution of the alleged crime” and that it was considered important to
include a provision to guarantee a person’s rights during the investigation phase before they are charged with a
crime.

conducted by the Prosecutor into the commission of a crime with a  
view to bringing to justice those deemed responsible”.102   
60. Thus, an “investigation” under the Statute is the inquiry conducted by the
Prosecutor. That is the only investigation regulated by Part 5 of the Statute,
including article 55. This is only logical: it would be an unwarranted expansion
of the Statute, and an infringement of States’ sovereign rights, if the Court
sought to extend the applicability of the statutory provisions that govern
investigations and prosecutions before the Court to domestic investigations and
prosecutions, which are governed by national law.  
61. This is supported by the interpretative principles laid down in article 31(1) of
the Vienna Convention, which the Appellant himself considers to be relevant:103
as the Appeals Chamber has held, the rule governing the interpretation of a
section of law is “its wording read in context and light of its object and purpose.
The context of a given legislative provision is defined by the particular sub‐
section of a law as a whole read in conjunction with the section of an enactment
in its entirety. Its objects may be gathered from the chapter of the law in which
the particular section is included and its purposes from the wider aims of the
law as may be gathered from its preamble and general tenor of the treaty.”104
The object and purpose of the Statute is to put an end to impunity through the
effective investigation and prosecution of crimes by this Court, when no State is
effectively dealing with them. Part 5 consequently regulates the manner in
which this Court must conduct investigations and prosecutions related to the
crimes defined in article 5 and it is precisely Part 5 of the Statute that provides
the “context” of article 55.   
62. The Appellant seeks to rely upon the expression “enquête ouverte” in article 55(1)
of the French version of the Statute to argue that this provision must be
interpreted to: (i) enable the Appellant to benefit from its protections from the

violations of article 55 committed by the CIV authorities at that time.105
However, this argument ignores the plain language also of the French text of
article 55(1) of the Statute that stipulates that this provision relates to “une
enquête ouverte en vertu du présent Statut”. Again, it is only the investigation
that is conducted by the Prosecution, or at most at the Prosecutor’s behest, that
qualifies as an investigation under the Statute triggering the article 55 rights.
Implied allegation of error of fact
63. Moreover, the Appellant has not alleged an error of fact in the manner in which
the Chamber concluded that there was no evidence that alleged article 55
violations were committed on behalf of the Prosecutor or any other organ of the
Court.   The Appellant also did not explicitly allege an error of fact as regards
the Chamber’s factual finding that the Appellant was “arrested and detained by
the [CIV] authorities and subsequently charged with economic crimes in
circumstances seemingly unconnected to the proceedings before this Court”.106     
64. The Appellant nonetheless asserts that: (i) there was a level of collusion
between the Prosecution and CIV in relation to his detention in the CIV; and (ii)
that his detention by the CIV authorities did have a connection to the
Prosecutor’s investigations. However, the Appellant fails to identify any
discernible error of fact in the Chamber’s conclusion that there was no such
collusion or connection between the Prosecutor’s investigation and his
detention by the CIV authorities and does not provide any ‘new’ arguments or
newly discovered evidence of any such collusion or connection.107    As the

Appeals Chamber has stated, it will not interfere with a Chamber’s factual
findings unless such findings are proved to be plainly unreasonable. 108   
Access to relevant information regarding communications with the CIV
65. The Appellant alleges that the Prosecution failed to disclose relevant
information regarding communications with the CIV, attaching inter partes
communications with the Prosecution in support of that allegation (which were
available to him before the Chamber issued its Decision, and which he failed to
bring before the Chamber).109   Nevertheless, the Prosecution observes that as
indicated in its response in Annex 1 to the Application, it provided to the
Appellant all relevant information pursuant to rule 77 of the rules or article
67(2) of the Statute.110   The Appellant fails to demonstrate how and why this
was not sufficient and what additional information the Prosecution had in its
possession and failed to disclose, or how this alleged lack of disclosure
impacted on the impugned Decision. An unsubstantiated claim of lack of
disclosure cannot constitute a proper basis for a proper ground of appeal.  
The Prosecution’s Response to the Seventh Ground of Appeal
Whether the Chamber erred in law in interpreting article 59(2) of the Statute
including in the exercise of control by the Court over the CIV’s compliance with
article 59(2)
66. The Appellant asserts that:  
(i) the Chamber misunderstood his arguments as he was not saying that
article 59(2) applied to the whole of the period prior to his transfer to
the Court, but was arguing that it applied to his treatment at the time

Prosecutor of 25 June 2012 at 09:50.

of his arrest.  However, the Appellant argues that for the purposes of
article 59, the relevant “arrest” should not be deemed when the CIV
authorities were given notice of the Court’s warrant of arrest against
him, but when he was first physically placed in custody (i.e. 11 April
2011 by the CIV authorities).111  
(ii) Second, the Chamber improperly narrowed the scope of its judicial
review of the CIV authorities’ compliance with article 59(2) and
applied the wrong test when concluding that the Chamber is only
required to ensure a suspect’s “basic safeguards” are respected when
arrested.112
Relevant “arrest” under article 59
67. The Chamber did not err in law, as the Appellant contends,113 in deciding that
the “arrest” relevant to article 59 of the Statute is the arrest following the
request for arrest and surrender issued by the Court.114 Indeed article 59 is clear
that the “arrest” to which it refers is an arrest emanating from a request from
the Court.    For instance, article 59(4) speaks of a custodial state’s “duty to
surrender the person to the Court” after receipt of the relevant request for arrest
or surrender issued by the Court pursuant to article 59(1).
68. The Chamber rightly determined that “stipulations of article 59 of the Statute
cannot be applied to the period of time before the receipt of the custodial State
of the request for arrest and surrender….”.115  Accordingly, the relevant time of
“arrest” was when the request for arrest and surrender to the Court was
executed and the Appellant was notified of the warrant of arrest and request for
arrest and surrender on 29 November 2011.116  Thus, the “arrest” under article

111 ICC-02/11-01/11-240, paras.139-141. 112 ICC-02/11-01/11-240, paras. 142-145. 113 ICC-02/11-01/11-240, para.139-141. 114 ICC-02/11-01/11-212, paras.99 and 101. 115 ICC-02/11-01/11-212, para.101. 116 ICC-02/11-01/11-212, para.102.

59(2) was not an arrest by an unrelated entity for crimes unrelated to
proceedings before this Court (the Appellant’s arrest in April 2011 by the CIV
authorities for economic crimes allegedly committed in the CIV), but the arrest
following the request issued by this Court.117  
   
Scope of the Chamber’s judicial review under article 59
69. Second, contrary to the Appellant assertion, 118 the Chamber did not err in law
(or improperly narrow the scope of its judicial review) when it stated that its
role with respect to proceedings under article 59 of the Statute is limited to
verifying that the basic safeguards envisaged by national law have been made
available to the arrested person.119   This is consistent with the decision of the
Appeals Chamber, cited by the Chamber in its Decision, namely that:
The enforcement of a warrant of arrest is designed to ensure, as article 59(2) of the
Statute specifically directs, that there is identity between the person against whom
the warrant is directed and the arrested person, secondly, that the process followed is
the one envisaged by national law, and thirdly that the person’s rights have been
respected. The Court does not sit in the process […] on judgment as a court of
appeal on the identificatory decision of the [national] judicial authorities. Its task is
to see that the process envisaged by [national] law was duly followed and that the
rights of the arrestee were properly respected.
70. The Appellant misconstrues the Decision when it suggests that by taking this
approach, the Chamber failed to “retain[] a degree of jurisdiction” over how the
national (CIV) authorities interpreted and applied their national laws.120  
71. In fact, the Chamber did retain its jurisdiction over how the national authorities
interpreted and applied their national laws, in that the Chamber: (i) reviewed
the steps taken by the national court in the arrest and surrender proceedings

and the manner in which it dealt with the Appellant’s rights during the national
process; and (ii) concluded that the Appellant’s challenges were entertained by
the national court and he was afforded the basic guarantees of an arrested
person during the process, and there were no reasons to impose a stay of
proceedings as requested by the Appellant.121
72. Moreover, the Chamber’s approach is similar to that taken by Pre‐Trial
Chamber I in the Prosecutor v Lubanga (“Lubanga case”) which, when assessing
alleged violations of article 59 by [DRC] national authorities, limited itself to
considering only alleged “material” breaches of article 59.122 Similarly, the
Single Judge of Pre‐Trial Chamber III in Prosecutor v Bemba Gombo (“Bemba
case”), when dealing with allegations of procedural irregularities at the national
level stated, relying upon the Lubanga jurisprudence,  that “the Court is not a
court of appeal in relation to the national authorities and…its power to review
questions of substance and procedure before national courts is limited.    The
Single Judge considers that such questions should primarily be raised and
pursued before the national authorities as these are better placed than
international jurisdictions to deal with such questions and, as the case may be,
to provide for an appropriate remedy.”123
The Prosecution’s Response to the Eighth Ground of Appeal
Whether the Chamber committed a manifest error of fact in not finding a violation
of article 59(2) during the procedure of transfer to the Court
73. The Appellant alleges that the Chamber committed a manifest error of fact in
not finding a violation of article 59 during the procedure of transfer to the Court
in that it: (i) applied too superficial a review of the national procedures adopted;
and (ii) failed to take into account certain arguments raised by the Appellant’s
counsel.

74. As already advanced, the Appeals Chamber has held that for errors of fact, it is
necessary that an appellant demonstrate a “clear error” and that “[t]he question
is not whether the [chamber] could also have reached other conclusions. The question is
whether the [chamber] could not have reasonably reached the conclusions it did on the
available evidence”.124   
75. The Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the Chamber made a discernible
error of fact, in particular that the Chamber could not have reasonably reached
the conclusions it did regarding the question of whether there was a violation of
article 59(2) during the procedure of transfer to the Court on the available
evidence.
76. The Chamber did refer to the available evidence125 and its conclusion that the
Appellant was afforded the basic guarantees of an arrested person is reasonable
bearing in mind the factors highlighted in its review of the process adopted by
the national CIV court, including that before authorising the surrender of the
Appellant to the Court, the national CIV court: (i) notified the Appellant of the
arrest warrant; (ii) satisfied itself of the Appellant’s identity; (iii) considered the
arguments raised by the Appellant’s counsel including alleged irregularities in
the arrest procedure in light of his official status and the alleged inapplicability
of the Statute in proceedings before Ivorian courts; and (iv) decided on issues
raised by the Appellant’s counsel.126
77. The Appellant misconstrues the Decision Contrary to his assertions, the
following allegations were in fact addressed by the Chamber, namely: (i) the
timing of when the Appellant’s lawyers were told of the transfer;127 (ii) the
presence of armed men in the court including during deliberations;128 (iii) the
argument that the Statute has no legal effect in Ivorian law as it was not

of an appeal against the surrender decision under Ivorian law130 (although the
Prosecution observes that the Appellant did lodge an appeal under Ivorian law,
which is still pending).131    In any event, these points were not crucial to the
Chamber’s final determination,132 as the Chamber rightly stated that the issue is
simply whether the Appellant was afforded the basic guarantees of an arrested
person.
The Prosecution’s Response to the Ninth Ground of Appeal
Whether the Chamber erred in law in qualifying [part of] the request of the
Appellant as being based on an abuse of process
78. The Appellant contends that the Chamber erred in law in qualifying his request
as being based on an abuse of process.
79. The Appellant requested a permanent stay of proceedings on the grounds of
alleged serious violations of the Appellant’s fundamental rights.    Consistent
with the practice before this Court, the Chamber rightly characterised this
demand as a challenge based on an ‘’abuse of process’’, as that in essence is the
basis for requesting a stay for serious rights violations.    As the Appeals
Chamber has previously explained: “[t]he doctrine of abuse of process had ab
initia a human rights dimension in that the causes for which the power of the
Court to stay or discontinue proceedings were largely associated with breaches
of the rights of the litigant, the accused in the criminal process, such as delay,

129 ICC-02/11-01/11-212, para.105: “the national court made specific reference to the arguments raised by the
counsel for Mr. Gbagbo…including…the inapplicability of the Statute in judicial proceedings before Ivorian
courts”.
130 ICC-02/11-01/11-212, para.74 (“the immediate transfer of Mr. Gbagbo to the Hague after the closing of the
hearing was inconsistent with the suspensive effect of an appeal against a surrender decision under Ivorian law”);

confirmed that a chamber’s reasoning does not “necessarily require reciting each and every factor that was before
the respective Chamber to be individually set out, but it must identify which facts it found to be relevant in coming
to its conclusion”. See also Case of Van de Hurk v. The Netherlands, Judgment of 19 April 1994, Eur. Ct. H.R.,
Series A, vol.288, para.61. The European Court of Human Rights has confirmed that a tribunal is not obliged to
give a detailed answer to every argument.

illegal or deceitful conduct on the part of the prosecution and violations of the
rights of the accused in the process of bringing him/her to justice.”133
80. Nevertheless, regardless of how the challenge is characterised, the same
principles, as previously enunciated by the Appeals Chamber, apply when
requesting a permanent stay of proceedings based on alleged serious rights
violations.  And these principles were correctly relied upon and applied by the
Chamber in this instance,134 as follows:  
(i) First, even though ‘abuse of process’ (and/or serious rights violations)
are not explicit grounds for challenging jurisdiction (under article 17
of the Statute), the Appeals Chamber has held that a court of law is
vested with the authority to stop judicial proceedings “by declining
jurisdiction in a judicial cause, where to do otherwise would be odious to the
administration of justice”.135    Moreover, in light of article 21(3), the
Appeals Chamber has further held that “[w]here fair trial becomes
impossible because of breaches of the fundamental rights of the
Appellant or the accused by his/her accusers, it would be a
contradiction in terms to put the person on trial”.136
(ii) Second, a permanent stay of proceedings is a remedy of an
exceptional nature and not every infraction of the law or breach of
rights of the Appellant will give rise to a finding of abuse of process.
In particular: ‘’the illegal conduct must be such as to make it otiose,
repugnant to the rule of law to put the accused on trial”. 137  
(iii) Third, the relevant jurisprudence states that a chamber can consider a
permanent stay of proceedings as a result of abuse of process only
when:

No. ICC‐02‐11‐01/11 32/35 28 September 2012
i. “[E]ither the foundation of the prosecution or the bringing of the
accused to justice is tainted with illegal action or gross violation of
the rights of the individual making it unacceptable for justice to
embark on its course.”138 In other words, a permanent stay of
proceedings may only be ordered when the breach of the
Appellant’s rights makes the fairness of the proceedings against
him impossible.139
ii. Accordingly, “[a]t issue is the process of bringing the appellant to
justice for the crimes that form the subject‐matter of the
proceedings before the Court.”140
81. The Appellant has further misconstrued the decision to which he refers from
the Bemba case, as Pre‐Trial Chamber III did not take a different approach but
instead relied upon the Lubanga jurisprudence in dealing with allegations of
procedural irregularities in proceedings before the national authorities, and did
not deal with allegations of serious rights violations.141  
82. The Pre‐Trial Chamber’s conclusion that the Appellant’s request had to be
treated as an abuse of process was correct. Also, the Appellant has also failed to
demonstrate how the alleged error could invalidate the Decision. Therefore, the
ground of appeal must necessarily fail.

The Prosecution’s Response to the Tenth Ground of Appeal
Whether the Chamber erred in law with respect to the necessary conditions
required for finding an exception to jurisdiction
83. The Appellant alleges that the Chamber erred in law in the conditions it
stipulates are necessary for finding an exception to exercising jurisdiction, in
particular in its finding that the alleged violations of a suspect’s rights must be
attributable to the Court.  The Appellant alleges that: (i) the Chamber has not
properly applied the Lubanga jurisprudence; (ii) on the facts there was close
cooperation between the organs of the Court and CIV and the Appellant
suffered from torture and ill treatment; and (iii) a fair trial before this Court is
impossible, as demonstrated by the postponement as ordered by the Chamber,
due to the impact on his health of the torture and ill treatment sustained during
the prior detention  on his health.  
84. There is no error in the Pre‐Trial Chamber’s conclusion that in order for the
Court not to exercise jurisdiction on the basis of serious violations of a
Appellant’s rights making a fair trial impossible, it is necessary that those
violations are: “(i) either directly perpetrated by persons associated with the
Court; or (ii) perpetrated by third persons in collusion with the Court”.  
85. To the contrary, the Chamber instead simply followed the approach adopted in
the Lubanga case. In that case, the Appeals Chamber, when reviewing the
approach taken by Pre‐Trial Chamber I in response to allegations of “concerted
action” between the Prosecution and (DRC) national authorities, highlighted
that: “[t]he material before the Pre‐Trial Chamber respecting communications
between the Prosecutor and the DRC did not reveal any impropriety on the part
of the former […].    Mere knowledge on the part of the Prosecutor of the
investigations carried out by the Congolese authorities is no proof of
involvement on his part in the way they were conducted or the means
including detention used for the purpose”.142 The Appeals Chamber also

No. ICC‐02‐11‐01/11 34/35 28 September 2012
emphasised the fact that the crimes for which Mr. Lubanga was detained were
“separate and distinct from those which led to the issuance of the warrant for
his arrest”. 143
86. Even more crucially, as the Appeals Chamber emphasised:    “[a]t issue is the
process of bringing the appellant to justice for the crimes that form the subject‐matter of
the proceedings before the Court.  The Pre‐Trial Chamber determined that it is in
relation to this process that breaches of the rights of the Appellant or the
accused may provide ground for halting the process. And none was shown”
(Emphasis added).144
87. The Appeals Chamber further held that the question is whether a fair trial
before this Court becomes impossible because of breaches of fundamental rights
of the Appellant or the accused.145  It is only logical that this must relate to acts
attributable to the Court for a fair trial before it to be rendered impossible.  
88. The Prosecution notes that the Appellant appears to be requesting in the
alternative that the Appeals Chamber depart from its prior ruling in Lubanga
and embrace a wider approach to abuse of process.146   The Prosecution notes
that the Appeals Chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Former
Yugoslavia (“ICTY”) concluded in Prosecutor v Aleksovski, after reviewing the
jurisprudence of both common  and civil law jurisdictions and the International
Court of Justice, that while it did have the authority to depart from previous
decisions:    it should only do so “for cogent reasons in the interests of justice”.147  
While not binding on this Court, the Prosecution considers that the Aleksovski
approach to previous case‐law emanating from the Appeals Chamber is sound
and fosters legal certainty in proceedings before the Court.
89. No such  cogent reasons have been provided by the Appellant in this instance.  
Accordingly the request should be rejected.
