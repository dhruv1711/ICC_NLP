1. The Office of the Prosecutor (‘’Prosecution’’) herewith files on the case
record the disclosure note regarding the provision to the Defence team of
Laurent Gbagbo on 3 April 2012 of one document pursuant to Article 67(2)
of the Statute.  
2. The document disclosed today was initially identified as incriminating in
nature and submitted in the Prosecution’s Second redaction request.1 Upon
further review, the Prosecution informed the Chamber and Defence that it
did not intend to rely on this document at the confirmation hearing. 2
Therefore it has been disclosed today under Article 67(2) of the Statute. The
redactions to the metadata of this document were authorised by Pre‐Trial
Chamber I in its First decision on redactions.3
3. According to the same decision, this document was to be disclosed on  
2 April 2012.    Because of technical issues related to Ringtail and the
implementation of redactions and encryption of the DVD to be disclosed, the
Prosecution was only in a position to disclose the document today.    The
Defence was kept informed at all times of our technical difficulties.
4. Pursuant to Pre‐Trial Chamber III’s order of 24 January 2012 4 , the
Prosecution provided the Defence with the disclosure note containing the
list of the material disclosed.
