1. On 22 June 2011 the Presidency of the International Criminal Court ("Court")
issued a Decision Constituting Pre-Trial Chamber III and Re-assigning the
Situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire.
2. On 3 October 2011, Pre-Trial Chamber III ("Chamber") issued a Decision
Pursuant to Article 15 of the Rome Statute on the Authorisation of an Investigation
into the Situation in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire, in which it authorised an
investigation.
3. On 25 October 2011, the Prosecutor filed an "Application Pursuant to Article 58
as to Laurent Koudou Gbagbo" for the issuance of a warrant of arrest for
Laurent Koudou Gbagbo" ("Mr Gbagbo") on four counts of crimes against
humanity based on his individual responsibility for the crimes of murder,
rape and other forms of sexual violence, persecution and inhumane acts
committed during the post-election violence from 28 November 2010
onwards by the Ivorian Defence and Security Forces ("FDS"), reinforced by
the pro-Gbagbo youth militia and mercenaries (hereafter referred to
collectively as the "pro-Gbagbo forces"), in Abidjan, including around the
Golf Hotel, and elsewhere in the country.
4. The Chamber notes Articles 19(1) and 58(1) of the Rome Statute ("the Statute")
and observes that the analysis of the evidence and other information
submitted by the Prosecutor will be set out in a decision to be issued hereafter.
5. The Chamber considers, on the basis of the evidence and information
submitted by the Prosecutor, and without prejudice to its determination of
any future challenge to the admissibility of the case under Articles 19(2)(a)
No. ICC-02/11 3/9 23 November 2011
ICC-02/11-01/11-1-US-Exp 25-11-2011 3/9 CB PT ICC-02/11-26-US-Exp 23-11-2011 3/9 FB PT
Pursuant to Pre-Trial Chamber III's instructions, dated 24/11/2011, the document has been transferred into the Case file
ICC-02/11-01/11-1 30-11-2011 3/9 EO PT
Pursuant to Pre -Trial Chamber III 's Decision ICC-02/11-01/11-6-Conf, dated 29/11/2011, this document is reclassified as Public
and (b) of the Statute, that the case against Mr Gbagbo falls within the
jurisdiction of the Court and is admissible.
6. On the evidence, the Chamber concludes that there are reasonable grounds to
believe that in the aftermath of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire proGbagbo forces attacked the civilian population in Abidjan and in the west of
the country, from 28 November 2010 onwards. They targeted civilians who
they believed were supporters of Mr Ouattara, and the attacks were often
directed at specific ethnic or religious communities.
7. The Chamber finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe that these
attacks by pro-Gbagbo forces during the post electoral violence were
committed pursuant to an organisational policy. Furthermore, they were
widespread and systematic, as demonstrated, inter alia, by the extended time
period during which crimes were committed (between 28 November 2010
and May 2011), their geographic spread (many of the neighbourhoods of
Abidjan and the west of Côte d'Ivoire), the high number of reported victims
and the general pattern of the way in which the offences were committed.
8. On the evidence, the Chamber finds that there are reasonable grounds to
believe that the crimes against humanity of murder under Article 7(l)(a), rape
and other forms of sexual violence under Article 7(l)(g), other inhumane acts
under Article 7(l)(k) and persecution under Article 7(l)(h) of the Statute,
were committed in Côte d'Ivoire during the period between 16 December
2010 and 12 April 2011.
No. ICC-02/11 4/9 23 November 2011
ICC-02/11-01/11-1-US-Exp 25-11-2011 4/9 CB PT ICC-02/11-26-US-Exp 23-11-2011 4/9 FB PT
Pursuant to Pre-Trial Chamber III's instructions, dated 24/11/2011, the document has been transferred into the Case file
ICC-02/11-01/11-1 30-11-2011 4/9 EO PT
Pursuant to Pre -Trial Chamber III 's Decision ICC-02/11-01/11-6-Conf, dated 29/11/2011, this document is reclassified as Public
9. Furthermore, the Chamber finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe
that these acts occurred in the context of a widespread or systematic attack
directed against the Côte d'Ivoire civilian population within the meaning of
Article 7(1) of the Statute.
10. The Chamber finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe that Mr
Gbagbo bears individual criminal responsibility for the crimes charged in this
Application, as "an indirect co-perpetrator" pursuant to Article 25(3)(a) of the
Statute. In particular, there are reasonable grounds to believe that a plan
existed between Mr Gbagbo and his inner circle (his co-perpetrators), and
that they were aware that implementing it would, in the ordinary course of
events, lead to the commission of the offences set out above. Furthermore, by
implementing the plan, the co-perpetrators exercised joint control over the
crimes. Given the position of each member and their role as regards the plan,
they made a coordinated and essential contribution to its realisation. There is
a sufficient basis to conclude that the pro-Gbagbo forces that put the policy
into effect did so by almost automatic compliance with the orders they
received. Finally, there is sufficient evidence that Mr Gbagbo acted with the
necessary degree of intent and knowledge.
11. Although the Chamber is satisfied that this substantial test (as proposed by
the Prosecution), is made out, it is likely that this issue {i.e. Mr Gbagbo's
suggested liability as an "indirect co-perpetrator" under Article 25(3)(a) of the
Statute) may well need to be revisited in due course with the parties and
participants.

Pursuant to Pre -Trial Chamber III 's Decision ICC-02/11-01/11-6-Conf, dated 29/11/2011, this document is reclassified as Public
12. Finally, the Chamber is satisfied that his arrest is necessary to: i) ensure his
appearance before the Court; ii) ensure that he does not use his political or
economic resources to obstruct or endanger the investigation; and iii) prevent
the commission of further crimes.
