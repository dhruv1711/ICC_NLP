Introduction
1. The Prosecution objects to the Defence request that the Appeals Chamber order
that the deadline for its response to the Prosecution Appeal against the Article 61
Decision shall run only from the notification to the Defence of a French
translation of the Decision Granting Leave to Appeal, the dissenting opinion as
well as the Prosecution Appeal Brief. The Prosecution also objects to the
alternative request of the Defence to be provided an extension of four weeks to
file its response.
2. The Prosecution submits that the Defence has not shown good cause to justify
the requested relief. In particular, the Defence has demonstrated in the past that
it is perfectly capable to understand and to respond to decisions by Chambers
and to submissions by the Prosecution and the Registry that were filed in English
without there being a need to be provided with a French translation.
Background
3. On 3 June 2013, the Majority of Pre-Trial Chamber I (“Majority”) issued the
“Decision adjourning the hearing on the confirmation of charges pursuant to
article 61(7)(c)(i) of the Rome Statute” (“Article 61 Decision”).1 The Presiding
Judge appended a dissenting opinion.2
4. On 31 July 2013, the Majority, the Presiding Judge dissenting,3 certified leave to
appeal the Article 61 Decision (“Decision Granting Leave to Appeal”).4
5. On 12 August 2013, the Prosecution filed its appeal against the Article 61
Decision (“Prosecution Appeal”).5

6. On 15 August, the Defence filed an urgent request for the Appeals Chamber to
determine the date from which the deadline for the Defence to file its response to
the Prosecution Appeal shall run (“Defence Request”).6 In particular, the Defence
requests that the Appeals Chamber order that the deadline for its response to the
Prosecution Appeal against the Article 61 Decision shall run only from the
notification to the Defence of a French translation of the Decision Granting Leave
to Appeal and the dissenting opinion as well as the Prosecution Appeal. In the
alternative, the Defence requests to be provided an extension of four weeks to
file its response.7
Submissions
7. Under Regulation 35 of the Regulations of the Court, a Chamber may extend
time limits ordered by a Chamber or prescribed in the Regulations of the Court “if good cause is shown”. 8. The Prosecution submits that the Defence has not shown good cause to justify
the requested relief. The Defence Request is primarily based on the fact that the
Prosecution Appeal, to which the Defence intends to respond, is filed in English,8
and that French is the only language which Mr Gbagbo fully understands and
speaks.9
9. The Prosecution submits that translation into French of the Prosecution Appeal
Brief and other documents filed in English are, in the circumstances of this case,
not necessary to ensure the fairness of the proceedings.
10. The Defence team of Mr Gbagbo has abundantly demonstrated that it is perfectly
capable of understanding decisions and Prosecution submissions filed in
English, of communicating the substance of these filings to Mr Gbagbo and of
6 ICC-02/11-01/11-480. 7 Defence Request, pp.18-19. 8 Defence Request, para.25. 9 Defence Request, paras.72-77.

responding to them in French. It has done so throughout the Pre-Trial
proceedings and during appellate proceedings and in relation to very important
issues.
11. For instance, on 4 June 2012, the Prosecution filed its response to the Defence
request for provisional release pursuant to Article 60(2).10 This document was
filed in English and no official French translation is on the record of the case. The
corresponding decision was also rendered in English, with no recorded French
translation. 11 Nevertheless, the Defence filed an appeal 12 and a document in
support of appeal against that decision.13
12. Similarly, on 2 November 2012, the Pre-Trial Chamber rendered the decision on
the fitness of Mr Gbagbo to participate in the confirmation proceedings.14 The
Defence filed an application for leave to appeal, 15 long before the French
translation of that decision was notified on 17 April 2013.16 In the context of the
litigation relevant to the fitness of Mr Gbagbo to participate in the confirmation
proceedings, the Defence has also responded to many additional decisions17 and
filings by the Prosecution18 or the Registry19 that were available only in English.
13. The Defence also filed its appeal 20 and document in support of the appeal 21
against the Pre-Trial Chamber’s decision on the Defence’s challenge to the
jurisdiction of the Court,22 which was issued in English.23

14. The Prosecution further notes that the “Third decision on the review of Laurent
Gbagbo’s detention pursuant to article 60(3) of the Rome Statute” was issued in
English.24 The Defence has filed a request for an extension of the time limit for
the filing of the document in support of the appeal against that decision.25 In
spite of the similarity of the relief requested in that instance, the Defence did not
indicate that it needed more time because that decision was issued in English.
That request was primarily based on the workload of the Defence at the time.26
The Prosecution submits that if the Defence team really had difficulties to fully
comprehend Decisions and submissions filed in English and communicate their
content to their client, it would have mentioned those difficulties in its previous
submissions to the Appeals Chamber requesting for additional time.
15. On one instance only throughout the Pre-Trial proceedings, the Defence
requested that the time limit for its application for leave to appeal a decision be
ordered to run from the notification of the French translation of the Decision.27 In
that case, the Single Judge of Pre-Trial Chamber I found as follows: “In the
present circumstances, the Single Judge is of the view, based on the previous
course of proceedings in this case, that the unavailability at present of an official
French translation of the Decision does not affect the ability of Mr Gbagbo's
Defence to properly represent his interests. The Single Judge is therefore
confident that the Defence is already in position to analyse the Decision”.28 The
Single Judge nevertheless granted the Defence’s request in that instance, but only
because of “the importance of the Decision for the future proceedings in the
case”.29 The Prosecution submits that this assessment by the Single Judge, who
has been presiding over the case against Mr Gbagbo since his initial appearance
on 5 December 2011, should be given due weight.
21 ICC-02/11-01/11-240. 22 ICC-02/11-01/11-212. 23 No French translation of this decision is on the record of the case. 24 ICC-02/11-01/11-454. 25 ICC-02/11-01/11-456-Red2. 26 See also decision from the Appeals Chamber granting that request: ICC-02/11-01/11-458-Red, paras.3, 6. 27 ICC-02/11-01/11-433-Conf. 28 ICC-02/11-01/11-434, para.7. 29 ICC-02/11-01/11-434, para.8.

16. Finally, the Prosecution notes that the Defence requests, among others, to be
provided with a French translation of the Decision Granting Leave to Appeal, as
well as the dissenting opinion of the Presiding Judge, which were issued already
on 31 July 2013.30 These two documents do not go to the merits of the Prosecution
Appeal and are therefore not material for the purposes of the Defence response
to the Prosecution Appeal. In fact, the Prosecution expressly submitted that its
appeal does not concern the Leave to Appeal Decision and that that decision “is
relevant only to the extent as it sets out the Issue certified for appeal”. 31
Therefore, the Defence does not need a translation of these documents to
respond to the Prosecution Appeal.
17. Based on the above, the Prosecution submits that the Defence Request in fact
amounts to a request for additional time to respond to the Prosecution Appeal.
This is because the Defence has abundantly demonstrated its ability to respond
to decisions and submissions filed in English and the Defence Request extends to
documents that are irrelevant for filing a response to the Prosecution Appeal.
The Defence has not shown good cause for such an extension of the time limit
and the Defence Request should therefore be rejected.
30 The Prosecution notes that the Defence, knowing that leave to appeal has been granted, it could have requested
the transaction of these documents much earlier. 31 Prosecution Appeal, para.8.

Conclusion
18. For the reasons set out above, the Prosecution submits that the Defence has not
shown “good cause” within the meaning of Regulation 35 and the Defence
Request should therefore be rejected.
